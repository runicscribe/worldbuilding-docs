### Note on Faerie and Midgard

Faerie loosely mirrors the human world in geography. Humans cannot enter it physically; likewise spirits cannot enter the human world.
Fey can move between human and spirit worlds freely, and can use differneces between the realms to bypass otherwise impassable obstacles.

## People

* [Humans](./humans.md) - Inhabitants of the mortal world.
  * [Hybrids](./hybrids.md) - Part-human, part-fae
* [Fae](./fae.md) - Immortal beings capable of travelling between the human and spirit worlds. Bound to always speak the truth.
  * Demons - Fae that have been imprisoned in hell for preying too much on humans. Main goal is to influence the human world by manipulating human magic users.
* [Spirits](./spirits.md) - Essences of natural phenemena, creatures, places that inhabit the spirit world.
* Eldritch - Denzeins of the outer realms of the reality. Exist in both the human and spirit worlds concurrently.

Between Warlocks, Summoners, and Fae revels, half-human hybrids are quite common.

## Magic


### Human Magic

Multiple magic systems. One person can't mix and match different magic systems - attempting to do so results in neither. 
In (very) rare cases, one may renounce their prior abilities and take on a new powerset.

Small magics are common - especially minor manifestations of Chi, Artifice, or Witchcraft.
By their nature, warlocks and summoners rarely deal in small magics, and consequently, are rarer than other types.
Powerful magic-users are rare. Powerful artificers are extreemely sought after, and help maintain the human megacities.



#### Summoner

Rule-oriented magic to summon a specific entity.
Requires a ritual to establish a contract with an entity, and then a simpler one to summon it as needed.
Nature of the ritual depends on the specific type of entity. Contract may be time-limited, or has some other completion condition. 
Can have multiple pacts at once, although it is usually a bad idea to be bound to multiple powerful entities at once.
Any one summoner is generally limited to a single class of entity (e.g. demon, or nature spirit), although there may be a little bit of overlap, e.g demons and djinn.

Their are some gifted summoners who are talented enough to summon lesser powers (like faeries, minor spirits, or lesser demons) without any foreknowledge of rules and rituals, 
yet never develop their talents further than this - this is pretty much the only "small-magic" manefistation of the summoner's art. This particuar form of summoning is also similar
to some aspects of witchcraft.

* Fae
  * Demon
  * Djinn
  * High Fae
  * Wood Fae
* Nature Spirit
* Ancestor Spirit

#### Cleric

Devotion to an entity in return for magical abilities.
Larger variety of powers then some magic users, with less control over what you actually get.

* Holy - Light, healing, protection, exorcism.
* Eldritch - Tentacles, knowledge, madness, translocation.
* Gaia - Talking with animals, plant control, weather magic.

#### Witch

Ritual magic to create effects and objects. All magic requires ingredients, and some sort of ritual, and may also requre a specific location or date. Subtle, but versitile.
Moslty relies on potions and other magical items for "fast" effects. Witch-made magic items are usually one-use-only, or passive (e.g. good luck charms, etc.), unlike those created by artificiers.
Typically on good terms with the local spirits and fae.

* Green/Life: Nature and fertility magic, crops, healing potions. Blessings of flourishing and curses of overgrowth.
* Black/Death: Seances, necromancy, potions and poisons using animal parts. Blessings of quieting and curses of withering.
* Star/Celestial: Prophecy, Astrology, Lunar/Seasonal magic. Rituals tend to focus more on dates than ingredients.

#### Warlock

(Permanently) Merge essence with a spirit or fae for a variety of powers, (sometimes) including shapeshifting into a form similar to that of the spirit, or projecting the spirits essence outside of their body.
Summoners occasionaly become warlocks (intentionally, or not).

Because becoming a warlock is an irreversible alteration of one's essence, few attempt it, making it the rarest form of human magic.

* Spirit
  * Animal
  * Elemental
  * Ancestor/Folk Hero
* Fae
  * Demon
  * Djinn


#### Artificer

Building things that shouldn't really work the way they do. Also responsible for the existance of the human megacities.

* Magic artifacts - Items with simple magic effects
* Steampunk/clockwork: Trains, skyships, automatons, transforming objects that take up less space than they should.
* Computers - Mind uploading, robotics, nanomachines
* Art - Paintings you can visit, entrancing melodies, living sculptures.

#### Chi

Magic that works through training, "luck", and physical feats.

* Fists / Martial arts
* Tools - swords, gun-fu, car-fu
* Spiritualism (?) 

### Fae Magic

Glammer - ability of all fae, expression varies

Elfcraft - Learned magic. Similar to witchcraft and artifice, although less finnicky and more powerfull. Most commonly used by elves, but not limited to them. Power tied to connection with faerie; will be weaker "farther away"

Abilities - subset of abilities unique to fae type. Also includes restrictions, and connection to Faerie. Tied to the core essence of the fae, cannot change.
