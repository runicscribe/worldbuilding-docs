# Cities 

Across Midgard, nature is particularly persistent. 
A building left unnatended will be swallewed up by plants in a matter of weeks. etc.
More aggressive means of fending off nature (like burning down nearby forests) provoke a violent result from the local Fae, and are therefore avoided.

Human cities and settlements are built in a variety of ways to to get around this, without causing so much damage to unduly anger the fae.

## Leyholds

The largest cities in midgard are build around powerfull leylines. Power of the leylines provides defense against encroachment of nature. 
Power of the leylines provides several benefits
- Creation of magical wards that defend against the encroachment of nature. These wards primarly protect the city itself, but also extend somewhat into the surrounding countriside, allowing most leyholds to mantain expansive farmland.
- Empowers artificiers craft, allowing cities to be built to otherwise impossible heights. This also causes artifacts manufactured in such cities to be inherently higher quality.

Leylines are rare, and often occur in rather unique locations, that aren't always well suited to cities. The power they provide allows these limitations to be overcome, but often results in rather unique architecture.
Furthermore, because of their rarity and the advantages they provide, many leylines have hosted a city for basically the entirety of human history, resulting in extensive underground ruins and mixed architectural styles.

Most heavy industry is housed in these cities, along with government and commerce.

### Food Production

The majority of food production is based out of leyholds. This mainly consists of large-scale farming, which is only possible within the leyhold wards (usually a radius of a little under a days travel surronding the city) 
Coastal leyholds also have extensive fising enterprises.

Most other food production (outside the wards of a Leyhold) is opporunistic hunting and gathering.
Most hermitages do have some small-scale cultivated agriculture, although this only provides food for the denzien(s)

## Wandering Cities

Mobile, don't allow nature to stick.
Compared to leyholds, relatively shortlived - rare to find one older than a couple hundred years.

Usually built upon a leviathan, but some are completely artificial.

Ground, sea, or sky.

Ground require more maintenance
Sea and sky more vulnerable to weather.

Anywhere from a glorified trading caravan housing one or two families to large cities build on the top of ancient leviathans.


## Frontier Encampments

Temporary encampments that must actively fight off nature.
Generally spring up near resourses of high value that aren't near a leyline.
Usually don't last long.

## Hermitages

Monks or Witches

Rarely larger than one or two buildings.
Built in nature, but more harmoniously. Often partly engulfed by wilds. Protected through a combination of owners magic, agreements with local fae, and conventional maintenance.
Rapidly reclamed when their owner moves on.

## Fae Cities

Genrally grown / constructed organically out of nature, and extend partly into Fairy. Effectively part of the surronding nature and not at risk of being consumed. 
Populated largely by elves, but some Fae Cities do have a small population of transient humans.

## --
(Name TBD: Sanctum, Conclave, ...)

Rare (semi)-natural locations protected by a geas - as long as humans don't damage the space, are protected from all harm (even passive) from fae.
Used for negotiations, revels, and other etc.
Pathways leading to such sites are similarly protected.
