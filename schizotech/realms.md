# Realms

The world is divided into five realms.
Midgard and Faerie are overlaid upon each other. The other realms adjoin the borders Midgard and Faerie.

## Heaven 

Realm of the gods. Above the clouds

## Midgard

Mortal Realm. Flat and ringed with mountains.

### Northern Continent

#### Olympus

Tall mountain at the center of Midgard

### Southern Continent

### Eastern Sea

### Western Sea

### Ice Wall

Border of the world - merges with Faerie

#### Polaris

Bastion of the snow fae

### The Deep Dark

Border of the world - merges with Faerie

#### The Molten Forge

#### Gates of Hell


## Faerie

Realm of spirits and ghosts. Overlaid with Midgard world.

### Roots of Olympus

In the center of Faerie is a great tree, with its canopy shrouded by the clouds. It corresponds to the location of Olympus in midgard.
The trees roots end in a great lake - whenever a fae is killed, they are reborn from the waters of this lake.


## Outer Realms 

Realm of the other. Beyond the borders of Midgard

## Hell

Prison of the gods and realm of demons. Below the earth.
