# Giants

Large humanoids.
Mostly keep to themselves.

## Frost Giants

Communal. Live in great halls carved out of the great icewall. Accomplished crafters - much of the Snow-fae's gear that isn't made by the Deep Fae is made by the Frost Giants. Also act as a deterrent to humans. 
Not inherently hostile, but very prideful, and this extends to their relations with other fae, some giants have elf-bone trophies taken from visitors who didn't respect them.

Mostly work in whalebone, leather, enchanted ice, bronze, and meteoric iron.
Many of there smith have the skill to work mithril or adamantine, but rarely have access to it, except when repairing the arms of the snow elves.

In addition to smithing talents, have some weather magic.

Fair number of settlements spead around the edge of the world.
Build great ships out of wood and whalebone, that they use to visit other Frost Giant settlements

## Stone Giants

Grey, stonelike flesh. Lazy, often slumber for many years. Mostly solitary.
