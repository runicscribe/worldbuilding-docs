Gorgons are a rare variety of fae that guard leylines. They are exceptionally dangerous, as they can channel the power of the leylines to perform magical feats beyond that of a normal Yokai (most notably petrification). 
There is one Gorgon soul for each great leyline in the world. Given that humans have claimed many of these, they now congregate in groups around the leylines that still remain under fae control, 
making them even more difficult to conquer. Individual gorgons have a more varied appearance and powerset than their shared name would imply, but most still do have serpentine influences.

Known Gorgons:

Shattered Glass - Guardian of the Olympus Leyline, and perhaps the most powerful gorgon, comparable in power to the Elder Fae.

  A vertical halo of floating glass shards orbit their face, which emanates a bright light that obscures its features.
 (2 or 4) arms, serpentine tail, covered in irregular, iridescent, glass-like scales.

  Can channel a beam of burning light from their face, capable of melting adamantium. Can turn invisible. Can fly. Can phase between Faerie and Midgard more or less at will, giving the semblance of teleportation.
  
The Twins.

  Black and white serpents, entwined.
  Originally one guarded <oldest human settlement>. Now been together so long they are practically inseperable, both literally and figuratively.
  
  
The Tower / Calamity / The Dark Sorceress

  Most proactive of the displaced gorgons, and most human in appearance. Mind-affecting powers.

Aside - # of gorgons - TBD. Prime number, somewhere betwen 12 and 30?
Used as face cards in a Tarrot-equivalent?
