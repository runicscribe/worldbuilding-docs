# Spirits

All things in the physical world (except Fae) have a spirit-world counterpart.

This includes living things like plants, animals, and humans; objects like rocks; places like cities and rivers; and more abstract concepts like weather events and ...

Most spirits have no effect on the physical realm , but more powerful ones can influence the forces they govern.

When a living thing dies, their spirit persists. In most cases, this spirit will gradually fade into the background of the spirit world. Particularily anguished spirits can make their presence known to the physical world.
Sometimes many spirits will come together to form something that persists untetherd with anything in the physical world. 

The first human gods formed in this way, from collected spirits lingering in early human graveyards. 
Shortly after their formation, they enlisted the High Fae to ferry human spirits to their domain, so that they weren't just left wandering aimlessly in the spirit realm. 
Since dead human spirits were no linger left to linger en-masse, this also had the side-effect of preventing the formation of new human gods, thus solififying the supremacy of the existing ones.

Sometimes, the spirit of a particularly notable figure will persist. Can continue their legacy by joining with a human warlock. After a few cycles of this, 
the gestalt spirit of the original soul and all their subsequent hosts will become powerfull enough to gain some autonomy within the spirit world. This process might eventually result in a new god.

Because spirits persist after death, most human cultures have fairly intricate funeral rites.

## Spirits and Fae

As the only other type of entity that can freely travel the spirit realm, Fae interact with spirits on a regular basis. 
This is usually amicable, but sometimes the more powerful and autonomous spirits may clash with the goals of the Fae.

When Fae strand the rare humans in the spirit world, their interactions with the spirits tend to go much less well, mostly due to mutual unfamiliarity.
