### Flying Jellyfish

Communal organism similar to Man-o-war.

Larval stage is an aquatic barnacle like creature with several long tendrils and a bulbous head, covered in a shell.
Lives near volcanic trenches and bioaccumulates helium (?) in sacs around its head.
As colonies grow, they merge together, and eventuall lift the rock they are attached to out of the water. Remain underwater for a while longer, periodicly joining up with other colonies. 
Eventually break down the rock they are attached to,  at which time they float into the air, protected only by a light chitin shell. At this stage, have many 10+ meter long traslucent paralytic tendrils that dangle below the 
colony and snare surface feeding fish and birds.
Height and length of tentacles is adjusted so they just touch the top of groundcover when over land, and about 10cm into water when over water.

Can control height by storing and releasing waste, but horizontal motion is mostly at the mercy of the wind (tentacles can retract to protect them and reduce the effect of wind)

Largest colonies are big enough to have small towns built upon them

## Leviathans

Variety of massive, near-immortal creatures that wander the land, sea, or sky. Frequently host wandering cities.
Many different types: Skywhales, giant sea turtles, giant aquatic arthropods, six-limbed land mammals, ...

Normal levaithans are ordinary creatures, and quite docile. However, there are also some levaithan-sized fae sea monsters that are more hostile.
