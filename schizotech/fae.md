# Fae

Fae serve as the bridge between the spirit (Faerie) and human (Midgard) realms. Can cross over between them (weaker fae need a place they have affinity with to cross over; elf lords do not).

Elves are the aristocracy of Faerie, and regularly act as a direct intermediary between humans and spirits. Most other fae eschew anything resembling civilization, and just protect or embody some aspect of the world.

Like humans, all fae are humaniod, although often have animal features. Like spirits, they mirror the nature of some place or thing, which is reflected by their appearance and abilities. Fae are usually human-sized as well, but not always (e.g. sprites, archdemons)


Cats can detect fae. Perhaps because of this, there are no feline fae.

Fae must speak the truth, and bound to fulfill all vows. Often can't (or won't) harm (for some definition of harm) humans directly. 
Elves have the strictest of these constrants, and are entirely incapable of harming humans (although typically have no issue seeing humans come to harm through their inaction)
All fae have approximately human-level intelligence, but very differrent priorities.

Fae have not need for food or rest, so their day to day routines are rather different than those of mortal creatures.
Elves have a hierarchy and responsibilties handed down from their lord, which governs much of their activities.
Additionally, most fae are subject to certain compulsions according to their nature - for example merrows are compelled to protect waterways, satyrs are always hungry and horny.

Immortal. Do not require sustenance - food, water, air. Cannot be killed by conventional means, but can be wounded or imprisoned (similar to greek gods, for example). 
Their physical form can be destroyed by powerful magical weapons, denzeins of the outer realms, and celestials. If this happens, they are reborn in a new body, with no memory of their prior life.
The only thing that can permanently destroy a fae are the greater entities from the outer realms.

## Glammer

All fae have limited illusiory and shapeshifting abilities, collectively referred to as glammer. Among other things, this allows them to pass as human.
Through their shapeshifting abilities fae's physical shape matches their mental image of themselves (although there's a bit of a chicken and egg question as to how much a fae's nature determines their shape, 
and how much their shape determines their nature; certain varieties of fae tend strongly towards one gender or another; e.g. most harpies are female, most lycans are male). 
As part of this, a fae's gender always matches their physical sex (Nonbinary and genderfluid fae do exist).
Any changes to a fae's physical form are slow and gradual (on the order of weeks to months), but simple cosmetic changes can be made quickly through the illusory half of the glammer.

Most fae do not bother with clothes or tools, relying on their glammer for cosmetic expression and magic for everything else. 
The only real exception to this is the elves - snow elves rely heavily on armor and weapons forged by the deep elves when fighting in the far realms, and many elf lords posses ancient heirlooms. 
Outside of these cases, elves will mostly just fashion a facsimile of clothing using their glammer.

## Biology

While fae are eternal, magical beings, they do have a real, physical form.
However, since they are shapeshifters with no need to eat or breathe, they have a fairly strange biology.
Their body is mostly skin, flesh, and bone, with very few internal organs:
 - Their bones are impervious to most forces, and any fleshy regions can heal from any injury. Damage to bones will also heal, but much more slowly.
 - Their skull contains something vaguely resembling a brain, which is tied to the lifeforce of the fae. Destruction of this organ is the only way to kill a fae's body (? although they can self-terminate if grievously wounded -> maybe only while in Faerie ?).
 - Fae have no heart or blood vessels, but their flesh is permiated with an all-purpose ichor which will seep from deep wounds. The color of this ichor varies between types of fae, but usually isn't red.
 - Their throat is a single tube joined to the mouth and sinus, that terminates in a spongy void in the center of their chest, which breaks down anything they consume.
 - Fae with internal genitals have a tube which terminates in a similar spongy void in their belly. This can be reconfigured into a womb if they choose to reproduce with humans.
 - Fae with external genitals have a similar (but smaller) organ in their testes and/or at the base of said genitals. 
 - Fae generally have no anus - for those that do it is solely a sexual organ, with the same tube and void configuration to other internal genitals.
 - Some fae have additional specilized organs modelled on real creatures(e.g. aquatic fae with a squid-like inksac) - these follow the same spongy void and tube configuration as all their other organs.
 
 Fae bodies decay rapidly when dead. (? process of decay breaks down bones, but bones can be harvested before this happens ?)


### Reproduction and Half-fae

Fae are infertile with each other, but can reproduce with humans. The offspring of such unions are mortal. This, combined with their immortalily means that there are a fixed number of fae.
Half fae always have notable physical traits from their fae parent, and these traits are dominant, such that their children will also share them (and any further descendants have a 50% chance)
The most common half fae are half-demons, half-satyrs, and half-kitsune. After that, offspring of elves, harpies, lycans, and various Onna are all reasonably common. 

#### Humman-soul fae
(Name TBD: Ascendants, Human-soul fae, ...)

Part-fae that have 3/4 or more fae heritage (usually children of half-fae foundlings) gain the durability, long lifespan and infertility of pure fae, but without the ability to reincarnate.
Rare, and usually live with fae, who are more accepting of immortality than humans. The few that do wind up living with humans are ...

### Reincarnation

When a fae dies (typically due to extreeme physical trauma), a shooting star can be seen originating above the site of their death and moving towards the hub of the world (Olympus).
Some time later (typically one to three weeks, but can be more or less under unusual curcumstances), a new fae body will emerge from the waters at the base of the world tree (in Faerie).
At first, the new body will look like a elvish humanoid with no distinguishing features, but the glammer will gradually reshape according to the fae's personality, until it resembles their former appearance.
There are two notable exceptions to this process:
1. In the exceptionally rare cases where an Elder Fae is killed, it will take substantially longer (sometimes many years) to reincarnate, but will emerge with a body quite close to its old form, both in shape and size.
2. Injuries inflicted by the denziens of the far realms persist between reincarnations and cannot be hidden by glammer (This is mostly only relevant to winter fae, as they are the ones who most commonly encounter said denzeins).

This reincarnated body will have the soul, personality, and abilities of the dead fae, but none of their memories. It will retain some of the knowledge of its former self - the ability to communicate with other fae, 
the instinctive knowledge of how to navigate faerie and midgard, and the approximate location of their former home. Typically, the High Fae who guard the world tree will assist the reborn in returning to their home.

## Elves

Communal, with a complex hierarchy. All elves are humanoid. 

High Elves - The Court of Heaven. Messengers of the Gods, and next most commonly seen by humans after the wood elves.
Snow Elves - The Winter Court. Defenders of the Far Realms, and sword enemies of the eldritch. Skilled warriors.
Sea Elves - The Court of the Sea. Scholars, Guardians of Forbidden Knowledge.
Wood Elves - The Woodland Court. Native to the wild places of Midgard, and the most commonly seen by humans.
Deep Elves - The Under Court. Guardians of Hell. Skilled smiths and architects.

Snow, and Deep elves look the most human, with only minor cosmetic variations like pointed ears and unusual colorations. 
High elves also look quite human, but generally have wings. Wood elves look vaguely human, but also have many plantlike features.
Sea elves are the least humanlike, with a tail (which sometimes replaces their legs) and fins.


Other Groups 

Wood Elves and Sea Elves are the most closely tied to the natural world, and as such the dividing line between a wood elf and (for example) a dryad, or a sea elf and a siren is very blurry. 
For most individuals, it is pretty obvious which category they fit into, but there's a notable overlap that includes especially hermitlike elves and sociable Onna; there is no actual strict dividing line.

The Guardians of the Underworld - Deep Elves responsible for guarding the gates of Hell.

The Far Patrol - The first line of defense for the Snow Elves. They roam the far realms and watch for eldritch incursions.
Valkyries - Snow Elves who wander Midgard and reanimate the dead to defend the far realms.
The Great Hunt

### Fae Hierarchy

While the elves are the only Fae group to have a true heirarchy, many of the more powerfull wild fae command enough respect that they can be considered to fall within a greater hierarchy encompassing all fae.


## On Fae and the dangers of Faerie

Fae are immortal, and have no need for nourishment. Because of this, fae food provides no nutrients and is consumed solely for pleasure. In a similar vein, fae revels can last for years without end.

Fae can bring humans with them into Faerie. They often overlook human limitations, so if one is not careful, visitors can starve to death while gorging on fae food, or dance until unconciousness, or merely wander faerie forever. 
This is often not caused by malevolent intent, but human lives already seem so short and fleeting, so fae generally don't care.

While in Faerie, humans will not notice their physical needs. If they die, their spirit will continue wandering Faerie without realizing. Their body may be found near where they crossed over.

### Elfdans

Also known as a "Fairy Ring" or "Elf Gate". A location where Midgard and Faerie are blurred together. Typically the only way humans can enter Faerie. 
Usually occur in places where fae frequently travel into and out of Faerie.
The most reliable indication of an elfdan is geometry that should be impossible in midgard - tunnels that ought to cross but don't, 
ponds that are far deeper than they should be, groves that seem to have only one path leading to them, etc. 
However, given that they tend to occur in cramped or obscured places like these, this unusual geometry can be difficult to notice.

Overgrown groves in the deep forest, tunnels surrounding deep elf strongholds, bottoms of selkie pools

The borders (edges as well as the sky and earth) of Midgard behave in a similar fasion, althought this is mainly a result of the structure of the adjoining realms

#### Revels

Large gatherings of Fae will temporarily merge together Midgard and Faerie at the site of the gathering. Revels are the most dangerous form of elfdan to humans, 
as to unwary travelers they look like large parties overflowing with food and drink. However, as this is all Fae glammer, it provides no nourishment, andtherefore often results in the human's death. 

#### Demenses

Lair of certain fae, especially Onna and Wardens, are often Elfdans as well. Usually the resident fae also has a greater degree of control over this region - can reshape paths and such.
If a humain is pulled into this lair, they will be stranded in Faerie.

### Bargains

### Changelings and Foundlings

Changeling - Fae 'raised' (often unknowingly) by humans
Foundling - Human raised by fae

## Yokai

Wild and dangerous (although not always malicious). Many Yokai (especially Onna and some Tricksters) are almost indistinguishable from humans, even moreso than elves. 
Others are more monstrous, but still humaniod. Some rare Yokai look entirely monstrous, and can be quite large. Many of the rarer Yokai are entirely unique in appearance.

## Onna/Otoko (Lurkers)
Solitary Fae that lead travellers to their doom. Usually tied to a broad area, like a lake, swamp, or mountain range. Act as the embodiments of natuaral hazards - drowning, exposure, getting lost in the wilderness. 
Cannot actively harm humans, only lead them into danger and/or restrain them. Most Onna look at least partially human.
   
  Fieldmaid - Fields - Relatively benign, mostly wastes fieldworkers time.
  Dryads - Forests
  Siren - Ocean
  Will 'o the Wisp - Swamps
  Yukki-Onna - Mountain and Tundra
  Mirages - Deserts
  

  Kelpie - Lakes - Can't act out of water, but as soon as you enter their pool can and will drag you under
  Selkies - Seashore
  Merrow - Rivers
  
  Lamia - Caves and Deep Jungle. Rare.
  Arachnae - Caves and Deep Forest. Rare.
  
## Wardens - Guardian Fae. Just as dangerous as Onna, but less malevolent. Unlike Onna, can harm humans if whatever they guard is threatened / disrespected, but will always give a warning first.
  Bridge Trolls - [F/M] - Guard human-made paths between large cities, to limit inter-city communication. Typically require a toll that is not so exhorbitant to cause oughtright hostility, but still sufficient to stop casual travel.
  Harpies [F] - Guardians of Mt Olympus
  Gorgons [F] - Guardians of Leylines. Exceptionally dangerous, as they can channel the power of the leylines to perform magical feats beyond that of a normal Yokai (most notably petrification). There is one Gorgon soul for each 
                great leyline in the world. Given that humans have claimed many of these, they now congregate in groups around the leylines that still remain under fae control, making them even more difficult to conquer.
				More varied appearance and powers than their name would imply, but most still do have serpentine influences
  
## Tricksters - Wandering Fae. Often cause mischeif and mayhem. Will usually be benevolent when treated well, and malevolent if not (or if they are ignored or chased away). Most common fae to find near humans.
  Kitsune - [F] City Tricksters. Can shapeshift between a fox and a human with fox ears and tail(s). One of the rare types of fae that are comfortable in cities. Interest in food, hospitality, precious things. 
    When sated, bring good luck and prosperity. When shunned, bring misfortune, and will steal money and spoil food. In modern times, a surprising number of Kitsune wind up as roommates to university students.
    * There are also similar fae that aren't foxes, but otherwise effectively the same, e.g. Coyote.
  Corvids - [F] Ooh, Shiny. Clawed feet, wings instead of arms. Steals shiny things. Least dangerous of the avian fae.
  Gremlins - [A] Tricksters found near machinery - anything from complex engines to waterwheels. Delight in sabotoging machinery in the most subtle, difficult ways to discover.
  Boggarts - [A] Little Nuisances. Short, goblin-like, sometimes furry (dustbunnies). Rarely seen. Cause minor troubles - damaged hinges, spoiled milk, etc. Can be appeased by a daily offering of food, 
    in which case they will instead cause minor boons (oiled hinges, polished metal). Avoids households with cats or dogs.
  Pixies - [F/M] Small and mercurial, but mostly harmless. 4-6 inch tall glowing humanoid with translucent insect wings. Steals small things, leads travellers home or astray, collects berries, braids flowers into the hair of sleeping humans. 
    Unlike most tricksters, just as likely to congregate around elves or other fae as humans. Relatively fragile for fae (so they tend to reincarnate often). Often have exagerated personalities.
  Woodkin - Humanlike, but with ankle-length hair made of leaves, and unusually large eyes. Very shy. Can change the layout of forests, redirect or erase paths, etc. Mostly focused on keeping people out of forests, especially those bent on exploitation.
  Stonekin - Much like woodkin, but native to caves and tunnels.
  Great Tricksters: Rare, capable of shapeshifting into anything and other powerful magic. May beg a small favor or charity, and will gift a great boon if obliged, or a great calamity if rebuffed. Alternativy may grant a wish unprompted, usually with a double-edged result.
  Jinni - [*] Fae imprisioned somewhere in Midgard rather than in Hell, usually as a stopgap measure. Often grant a boon in return for their release.

## Elf-kin - Passive fae that largely do not interact with humans. Often (but not always) asist the local elves
  Fairies - 4-6 inch tall humanoids with moth or buterfly-like wings. Maintain or improve natural beauty, and assist in the passing of the seasons.


### Hunters

Wide-ranging hunters. Medium groups. Actively dangerous.


Satyrs/Fauns - [M/F] Hedonists. Descend upon a place, drink & fuck everything they can, and move on to the next one in the morning. 
Lycans - [M] Lupine predators. Can only harm humans while in moonlight. May enter into a warlock-like bond with one of their victims in exchange for their life; if this happens the host will transform into a wolf form on the full moon.
Trow [M/F] - Steal children in the night and eat them or raise them as their own. 
  
## Demons

Demons are formerly ordinary fae (often Yokai) whose predations against mortals became so egregious that they were captured and imprisioned in Hell by other fae.

While their time in Hell often twists their appearance, they still retain the personality and abilities as when they walked the earth. All demons bear a pair of cuffs as a representation of their imprisionment (althoguh the appearance of these varies), and often have a pair of horns.

Demons (and anyone else in Hell), cannot enter Faerie, or otherwise leave Hell - the only ways out are through the Gate to Midgard, guarded by the Deep Elves.

The only exception to this is if their are summoned by a mortal warlock or summoner using a ritual incorporating .their true name, from when they roamed Midgard

### The Courts of Hell

Most demons align themselves with one of three courts according to their nature, althgough some choose to remain solitary. The courts main benefit is to spread knowledge of thier members among mortal summoners, 
and to work together to acheive shared goals - sowing discord among the mortal realms and seeking vengeance on the fae who imprisioned them. 

The Court of Temptation - Lust and Temptation. Mainly Sirens, Onna, and Satyrs.  
The Bloodsoaked Citatel - Violence, Murder, and Vengeance. Trolls, Kelpies. Fae who turned to wrath after their domains were destroyed.
The Chasm of Schemes - Greed, Envy, and Secrets. Kitsune, Faeries. The rare Elven demons most often wind up here.

=====================

Elf Court Brainstorming (Subject to Change)

While elves are eternal, there leadership isn't alwas so - sometimes cyclical. However leadership changes are rare.

# High Elves

The Court of Heaven or the Sky Court. Messengers of the Gods.

Leader is "Heimlyn, Lord of the Skies" - Messenger / Trickster archetype (Think Hermes + Loki, or the Monkey King or the like).
No consort in the Sky Court, but many lovers across the realms.
Also responsible for ferrying souls from Midgard to Heaven. Good relations with the Winter Queen though her role as a protector of the unquiet dead.
Classical "Greek God" aesthetic - dark skin, golden hair, glows with the light of the sun, "perfect" athletic body, normally nude or mostly nude, with occasionall billowing fabric. 

Power balance between the gods and high elves is interesting - since the "gods" are largely once-human spirits (and are now effectively kami), they cannot interact with the mortal realm in any way (they can only observe, 
and even that is only from a distance), and are dependent entirely upon the high elves for any real interacion with Midgard, leaving basically all the power in the hands of the elves.

In general, high elves look like dark-skinned humans, except that they (usually) have a pair (or more) of feathered wings. Size and location of these wings varies greatly - shoulders or mid-back is common, 
but small wings at the ankles or in place of ears is also frequent. Wings may appear disconected from body (although this is mostly illusory/glammer)

High elves rarely bother with real clothing, although may garb themselves in glammers of shimmering light or auroras.

## Responsibilities

### Lord of Skies.
Coordinate transfer of souls from Midgard to Heaven. Personally collects the souls of the unquiet dead gathered by the snow elf reapers.

### Hubwater guardians
Guard the world tree and guide reincarnated fae back to their domains.

### Soulwardens 
Gather departed human souls from settlements and ferry them to heaven.

### Nobles
Keep watch on the human gods.

### Emissaries
Deliver messages from the gods to the humans.

# Snow Elves 

The Winter Court. Defenders of the Far Realms, and sword enemies of the eldritch. Skilled warriors.

Leader is "Meg, the Winter Queen" - Wise leader archetype (Athena/Odin)
No consort. Celibate.
Withered left eye and arm, but otherwise has a warrior's build. Ice blue good eye, black hair with white streaks.
Black 5-pointed crown set with stars. Clad in robes and armor.

While primarily the guardians of the far realms, the snow elves also have some interaction with midgard.
Vakyries collect the bodies of slain warriors to serve in the fight agains the denzeins of the far realms, but also recieve and comfort the souls of the slain, until they can be collected by the high elves.
They also have close relations with the deep elves, who forge their armor and weapons. In return, the snow elves assist in capturing fallen fae bound for Hell and escaped demons.
Snow Elf Inquisitors also watch over Midgard and try to stamp out Eldritch Clerics.

Snow elves tend toward pale skin and dark hair, with blue or grey eyes. Unlike all other fae, many snow elves have visible scars, as the wounds inflicted by the denzeins of the far realms cannot be healed by normal means, 
or conventional magic.

Snow elves also have the weakest glammer of all the elves, and in addition to their Deep-smithed armor, they usually wear clothing made of fur and hide, and covered in protective charms.

## Responsibilities

### Queen of Winter
Coordinate defence against outer realms
Collect reaped souls and hand over to lord of skies.

### Winter Scions
Coordinate frontline defense and scouting activities

### Far Patrol
The first line of defense for the Snow Elves. They roam the border between Midgard and the far realms and watch for eldritch incursions.

### Inquisitors
Locate incursions in Midgard

### Reapers/Valkyries
Wander midgard to reap unquiet souls and raise war-dead and ferry them to the snow realms.

### Others
Comission and acquire weapons and armor from the deep elves
Raise elementels 

# Sea Elves 

The Court of the Sea. Scholars, Guardians of Forbidden Knowledge.

Lead by three co-rulers (and consorts), each with their own domain (although they meet frequently)
Gyre - Travels most out of the three, over both ocean and land. Silver-blue-green skin. Shark-like tail. Finned legs. Masculine
Abyss - Deep water. Rarely approaches the surface of the ocean, and has only ever set foot on dry land once in the last millenium. Transluscent skin, with chromatophores that can switch to completely black, 
and controllable bioluminescense. Lower half is mainly tentacles. Androgynous / NB
Shoal - Shallow water. Rarely visit's Abyss's demense, but they regularly meet at Gyre's palace. Very colorfull, lots of gossamer fins. Much prefers the sea to the land, but will venture out occasionally. Feminine

Somewhat at odds with the winter court, as the sea elves ceaseless search for knowledge sometimes leads them to enabling eldritch incursions and fallen fae. 
At the same time, this knowledge can also come in handy for fighting such threats.
Least human-looking of all the elves - fins and webbed digits and such (like Ixalan merfolk). Pale blue or green skin, often with colorful patterns. Sometimes have finned tails in addition to or in place of legs.
Many sea elves like collecting trinkets they find in their travels, and often wear jewelry of shell and coral and braded kelp. Some of these have minor magical properties, and may be bestowed as gifts upon favored humans.

Good relations with the high elves, whose messengers often uncover useful knowledge.

## Groups

### Leaders
Shoal - Presides over the border between land and sea. Coordinates the efforts of the collectors and couriers. Architecht of the Sea Elf cities. Patron of the freshwater Yokai,
Gyre - Emissary between Shoal and Abyss. First of the Stormwardens. Negotiates with other Fae powers.
Abyss - Presides over the ocean depths. Guardian of the Sea-elf library. Relations with the Elder fae and great spirits of the sea.

### Collectors, Couriers, and Wanderers:
Collect new knowledge and trinkets. Carry messages and packages between the various Fae courts.

### Archivists
Store, preserve, and organize collected knowledge.

### Stormwardens
Channel and direct storms, and watch over other water-fae


# Wood Elves 

The Woodland Court. Native to the wild places of Midgard, and the most commonly seen by humans.

Leaders - Gwendolyn, the Summer Queen, and her consort Greensleeves. Gwendolyn has a motherly figure and green and gold attire. The Greensleeves has a lined face and a farmer's hands. Perhaps leafy hair?

Despite being the most commonly seen by humans, the wood elves have the most adversarial relationship with them among all the elves, because of their role as protectors of nature.

Tanned appearance. Red, brown, or green hair, often with leaves or flowers growing from it. Brown or green eyes. Often use their glammer to manifest garb that appears to be made of living plants, or fur or feathers.
Can speak with animals and control plants. Almost all wood elves have no weapons, relying instead on woodcraft and their relation with nature. 
Generally, Wood Elf "clothing" consists entirely of glammer - because they are guardians of nature, they have a strict policy of not harming plants or animals, which leavs little in the way of raw materials.
Wood fae are also the most skilled at changing their glamer, and can become nearly indistinguishable from humans when they need to.

## Responsibilities

### Leaders
The Summer Queen - Parley with Elder Fae and greater spirits. Directs any large-scale assaults against human overreach.
The Greensleeves - Shapes the Summer Palace. Watcher of the woods - communes with all the lesser Fae and little spirits to keep an eye on the balance of the world.

### Scouts
Keep watch over existing human populations and identify new settlements. 
Scouts also host frequent revels, since there's often not much to do (and if a human happens to be caught up in one, well then thats just a handy source of information)

Some scouts integrate themselves into human cities, taking on the guise of humans and living among them. These elves typically work in pairs, alternating between parent and child roles every 30 years or so.
After a few hundered years, the fae family has often built up enough connections  to influence the actions of the city. 
These scouts also tend to spawn extended half-fae families, many of whom are aware of the elvish nature of their progenitor. 

### Greenshapers
Channel and direct growth of nature to discourage human exploitation and prevent any lasting damage.
Manage seasons. Work closely with faeries.

### Diplomats
Parley with local Yokai, Elder Fae, and spirits.


# Deep Elves

The Under Court. Guardians of Hell. Skilled smiths and architects.

Leaders:
Aúr Earth-queen - Miner, Explorer, and Demon-hunter.
Aule Steel-king - Forgemaster and Guardian. Rarely leaves the citadel.

Their artifacts are prized by human and elf alike.

Primarly work with Mithril and Adamantite, which are ores only found Faerie that represent platonic concepts (metalcraft and indestructibility, respectively), although also use natural minerals.
Mithril is strong, light, easy to work with, and will never rust or tarnish. It is one of the few materials capable of easily harming Fae.
Adamantine is virtually indestructible, but also heavy and extremely challenging to work with. It is primarly used in the armor and weapons of the Snow Elves, as its durability allows it to stand up reasonably well to the entrophic 
touch of the denziens of the Far realms. It is not any more effective at harming fae than conventional steel. Note: Adamantite is the name of the ore, Adamantine is the name when it is forged into a metal.
Because these materials come from Faerie, humans generally don't have access to them.

In addition to powerful armor and weapons, they make supernatuarally beautifull jewelry and jeweled clothing. However, they work entirely with minerals - metals and crystals. Their skill with crafting is so great, 
it can often be difficult to tell what parts of a Deep Elves appearance is crafted and what is glammer.

## Magic

Greater resistance to fire and heat than other Fae - effectively nonflammable, and can survive near lava (although prolonged immersion in magma is still dangerous to them)
Ability to shape stone, and travel though it unhindered.
Wardens can permanently bind other fae. The Demonguard can temporarily bind other fae.

## Responsibilities

### Leaders
Aúr Earth-queen - Miner, Explorer, and Demon-hunter.
Aule Steel-king - Forgemaster and Guardian. Rarely leaves the citadel. Binds the more powerful Demons, and creates the means by which the Wardens and Demonguards bind other demons.

### Wardens
Guard the gates of Hell. Bind captured demons.

### Earthshapers
Miners, Smiths and Architects - magically reshape the earth to extract minerals, create armor and weapons, and shape Deep Elf cities.
Conceal Deep Fae cities from human mining expeditions.


### The Demonguard
Track down & capture rogue fae.
May bind fae temporarrily when they don't have the resources to retrieve them.


# Elder Fae

Embodiments of Nature. At least as powerful as the Elf lords, but much less controlled.

### The Leviathan

Seas, storms, and ocean disasters

### The Horned One

The thrill of the hunt. Leader of the wild hunt.

### The Trickster

Chaos and Balance
