# Demons

Demons are formerly ordinary fae (often Yokai) whose predations against mortals became so egregious that they were captured and imprisioned in Hell by other fae.

While their time in Hell often twists their appearance, they still retain the personality and abilities as when they walked the earth. All demons bear a pair of cuffs as a representation of their imprisionment (althoguh the appearance of these varies), and often have a pair of horns.

Demons (and anyone else in Hell), cannot enter Faerie, or otherwise leave Hell - the only ways out are through the Gate to Midgard, guarded by the Deep Elves.

The only exception to this is if their are summoned by a mortal warlock or summoner using a ritual incorporating their true name, from when they roamed Midgard

## The Courts of Hell

Most demons align themselves with one of three courts according to their nature, althgough some choose to remain solitary. The courts main benefit is to spread knowledge of thier members among mortal summoners, 
and to work together to acheive shared goals - sowing discord among the mortal realms and seeking vengeance on the fae who imprisioned them. 

The Court of Temptation - Lust and Temptation. Mainly Sirens, Onna, and Satyrs.  
The Bloodsoaked Citatel - Violence, Murder, and Vengeance. Trolls, Kelpies. Fae who turned to wrath after their domains were destroyed.
The Chasm of Schemes - Greed, Envy, and Secrets. Kitsune, Faeries. The rare Elven demons most often wind up here.


## Known Demons

### Yssvioth of the Deep

Former Abyssal Sea Elf who delved a little to deeply into the mysteries of the outer realms. These delvings granted them a great deal of personal power, but also let the outer realms reach into midgard.
This incursion led to their imprisonment in hell.

Yssvioth is still connected to the outer realms, which gives them a lot more freedom than most demons. While they cannot entirely leave Hell, they can observe Midgard and Faerie, and project some small measure of power there.
Affinity with the outer realms makes even other demons wary around them. They have built a small court of their own below the Chasm of Schemes, consisting of a small number of corrupted demons.
 
###

The gorgon of the leyline over which the human city of ___ is now built.
Rage at being driven from the leyline was so great it persisted between reincarnations, and her continued assaults on the city sustande a 100 year war between the humans and all nearby Fae.
In the interest of salvaging some sort of truce, ___ locked her in hell, although the cities residents are still especially distrustful of fae.

Exceptionally dangerous, and only really suitable for killing humans or destroying their works. Should never be summoned within 100km of ___, or she will surely break free of the summoners control and go on a rampage.
