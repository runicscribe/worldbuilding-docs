## Half-fae

Offspring of a fae and a mortal. Half-fae traits tend to persist through a few generations. Rather common - half-fae are not seen as unusual in cities. 
More exotic half fae do stand out. Tieflings, and Pact-touched are often shunned. Lycans and Deerkin are sometimes shunned or seen as shameful.

Minor power from fae parent

Wood fae variants are most common, and have most variation. 
Winter Fae and and Earth Fae don't interact with humans basically at all, so half-fae descended from them are basically unheard of.

### Tieflings 

Children of (summoned) demons.

Curved horns, pointed ears, reddish skin.
Can supernaturally escape any non-magical, non-iron bindings.

## Pact-touched

Warlocks and Clerics (and to a lesser extent Summoners) gradually take on traits of their patron. More gradual with lesser pacts (demons, minor spirits). 
Almost immediate for pacts with celestials and denzeins of the outer realms.
