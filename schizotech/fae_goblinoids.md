# Goblinoids


A category of tricksters that typically mess with with humans possessions and homes, but rarely interact with humans themselves. 
Short, with green or brown skin, and exaggerated features.

## Goblins

Goblins are short, humaniod creatures. They stand between 2 and 4 feet tall and have leathery skin that can be various shades of brown or green.
Goblins vary greatly in appearance, with indivuduals having one or two uniquely exaggerated features. They can appear as male, female, or somewhere inbetween.
Most goblins do have large heads and ears relative to their body size. They are usually mostly hairless, apart from thier ears and nostrils, but sometimes have hair on their head as well.

Goblins do not wear clothes for modesty, but will do so for decoration - usually a mix of hats, jewellry, and other accessories they have stolen from humans.

Goblins typically live in small groups in forest, swamp or hilly encampments, from which they harras nearby human settlements.
They have a reputation as pests, thieves, and taiders. Goblins will break into houses (usually at night), steal things and make general mischeif. 


Goblins quite like bargains - if you can track them down, you can usually get what they've stolen back by trading something else. They have no real convept of ownership, 
so you can trade something you don't own, as long as the goblin has some way of obtaining it. They'll also accept a promise for something you don't yet have, but this is generally a bad idea - 
they will remember and come back for what has been promised to them, even if circumstances have made fulfilling the promise impossible. 
Trying to get stolen items back from goblins by any other means is usually a bad idea, as they will treat this as theft and may become violent.

Goblins have an unusal fascination with human children, and will sometimes steal them. They will never harm the stolen children, and like anything else goblins steal, the stolen child can be bargained back. 
If the goblins keep the child, they will try and raise them. This will keep the goblins out of mischeif for quite some time, aside from small thefts to fulfill the needs and desires of the child.
Children raised by goblins will eventually take over the troop, becoming a "Goblin King" (or Queen).


### Goblin King

Stolen child grows up.
Having been raised by goblins, tends to be chaotic. Largely pampered, so also autocratic and still somewhat childlike.

They may take concubines from among the goblin troop, which will invariably result in a host of half-goblins.
At this point, the troop can become a genuine threat to surronding towns, and may attempt to take them over completely.

Around 3 feet tall.
Tall, triangular ears.
Sometimes have prehensile tails.
Mostly hairles - sometimes have thin, wispy hair on their head, as well as nose or ear hair. 
Pale coloration, often some variation of khaki or pale green.

## Boggarts

1 - 3 feet tall
Medium to dark brown skin.
