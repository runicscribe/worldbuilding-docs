# Progenitor Facility

Facility on the southern continent. This continent has been terraformed to be difficult to access. There is a perpetual storm ring, high cliffs, and no shallow beaches, plus reefs, currents, and other aquatic hazards. The land on the central plateau is quite hospitable.

The facility is currently abandoned (except for a single Progenitor caretaker), but still mostly functional.
Controls do not respond to pure physical interaction. Some rare Illyon may be able to activate them.

## Technology

### Temporal Zones

Large enclosed areas that have regions of accelerated time for studying evolution.

### Genesis Ring

Biological experimentation technology, used to create most races.

Consists of various, seemingly floating, concentric rings. The main structure is extradimensional, and not normally visible.

Spatial distortion allows access to the inside of the subjects - this has the appearance of a clean cut, except that the halves are still connected, so fluids "teleport" between the two halves. Pushing or moving parts on one half will affect the other side.

### Stasis column

Two structures, with a column of light between them. Can be cylindrical or rectangular.

Old specemins or disembodied limbs can still be found in them.
