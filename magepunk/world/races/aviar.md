# Aviar

Humanoid. Avg height 4'8" - 5'6". Large pair of functional birdlike wings attached to their back, just below the shoulders. When fully extended, each wing is about 50% longer than the aviar is tall.
Slight, athletic build. Aviar of both genders tend to have petite, rounded features and narrow shoulders. Females have small breasts, while males have small genitals when not erect. Body hair tends to be short and straight. Tends towards weak arm strength and exceptional core strength.
Relatively fragile bones, but heals quickly (this can lead to problems if bones are not set properly).
Hair coloration generally matches wing coloration to some degree.
Wings are most often raptorlike, but seabird and owl variants exist as well. There is also a rare bat-winged subspecies.

## Culture:

Passions/Values: Freedom, Exporation, Knowledge
Professions/Skils: Explorers, scientific research, inventors, teachers, investigators, prospectors.

Naming:
Aviar have very freeform naming conventions. 
Typically, adult Aviar have a nickname they are commonly known by, plus one or more given names. 

Relations with other races:

Aviar tend towards feelings of superiority towards other races on account of their flight. Within the Aviar, those with crippled wings are often shunned.
There are Aviar cities where no other races are permitted, although this is mostly due to them being inaccessible to races that cannot fly. Airships are permitted, although any non-Aviar crew are restricted to the dock areas.
Aviar are considered flighty and unreliable by other races.
Individual Aviar are often shunned as thieves, miscreants, or transients. This is partially deserved, as young aviar typically spend several years wandering the world.

## Tribal Aviar

Primitive tribes of aviar flew nude, but painted with colourfull geometric patterns in wide rectangular or triangular blocks.
