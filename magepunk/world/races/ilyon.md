Illyon have undergone a history of persecution, usually "justified" by their "dangerous and unpredictable" abilities. As such, there are no true Illyon cities, although smaller towns and settlements exist. There are also nomadic Illyon communities. The Illyon population is quite low, relative to the other races. Most modern Ilyon live in the various multicultural cites on the west coast.

Naming:
* Idiomatic given name, generally associated with their talent. Not named until their first birthday. 
* Surname of the form <daughter of name> ("del____") or <son of name> ("das____").

Relations with other races:

Il'yon tend towards feelings of superiority towards on account of their powers. Due towards their history of persecution, there is also an undercurrent of fear towards other races.
There are no current Il'yon cities (although smaller settlements exits) so most Il'yon make their homes in cities founded/build by other races.
Individual Il'yon may be shunned as bad luck. Their abilities often cause them to be blamed for other mysterious happenstance. 
Il'yon as a whole are considered mysterious and dangerous by other races.
