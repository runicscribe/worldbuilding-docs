Passions/Values: Action, Change, Self-improvement.

Illyon have undergone a history of persecution, usually "justified" by their "dangerous and unpredictable" abilities. As such, there are no true Illyon cities, although smaller towns and settlements exist. There are also nomadic Illyon communities. The Illyon population is quite low, relative to the other races. Most modern Ilyon live in the various multicultural cites on the west coast.

Naming:
* Idiomatic given name, generally associated with their talent. Not named until their first birthday. 
* Surname of the form <daughter of name> ("del____") or <son of name> ("das____").

Relations with other races:

Il'yon tend towards feelings of superiority towards on account of their powers. Due towards their history of persecution, there is also an undercurrent of fear towards other races.
There are no current Il'yon cities (although smaller settlements exits) so most Il'yon make their homes in cities founded/build by other races.
Individual Il'yon may be shunned as bad luck. Their abilities often cause them to be blamed for other mysterious happenstance. 
Il'yon as a whole are considered mysterious and dangerous by other races.
 
## Tribal Ilyon
 
 Southern. Gold-tinted skin, but still pale.
 More in touch with how Ilyon talents 'work' - can predict (and influence?) what talents manifest.
 Use attuned crystals in jewelry, which glow when mainifesting their talent.

## Biology and Reproduction

In addition to the four visible glowing orbs (nexii) in an Ilyon's hands and feet, there are three internal orbs - head, heart, and groin.

Ilyon are commonly known to glow brighter when using their power, but they also manifest a similar glow during sex with another Ilyon. 
The proximity of the two groin nexii throw off sparks, which form the seeds of nexii in any potentiel child that may result from the coupling 
(otherwise, the sparks dissipate harmlessly after a few days). Some sparks may also spill to the ground - these also persist for a few days.

When born, the nexus chasms are still undeveloped, and form slowly over the first six months. In Ilyon culture, the sex of a child is determined solely 
by the shape of these chasms, regardless of genitals. This can be challenging for intersex or transgender individuals.
