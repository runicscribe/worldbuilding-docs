# Gnomen

Short, ~ 4 ft. Hands, feet, and head all similar in size to that of a human. 
They have a third, larger eye in the center of their forhead, which can see a little bit into the infrared, a little bit into nearby dimensions, and sense minerals through stone. 
Deceptively strong and sturdy. Good night vision - visible spectrum extends into the near-infrared.

Aptitude for mechanical things and rune-magic. Slight resistance to magic and insanity. Created tp be a servitor race. Rarely, a Gnomon will go "insane", and start building strange structures carved with runes.
Gnomen also have a low-level telepathic connection to other nearby Gnomen. This can be hijacked the Voyagers and their minions to control them.

Gnomen are considered insular by other races.
