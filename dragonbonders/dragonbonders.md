# Races

## Bonders

Humanoids with cervid horns and hooved feet. Once in their lifetime, can permanently bond with another living thing. Upon formation of this bond, a glowing orb manifests between their horns.
This bond allows them to communicate telepathiclly with their bonded, and grants them powers related top the creature they bond with.

Bonders are generally only romantically compatible with another bonder if their bonded creatures are compatible, although pairings with non-bonders also tend to work out.

Their are two main types of bonders - Fauns and Tyfs.

### Fauns

Fauns are more sylvan in appearance, with forked antlers, brown fur and a short, deerlike tail.
They typically bond with (subservient, non-sapient) animals.

- Mythcasters - Fauns who bond with powerful creatures to share their powers (e.g. cockatrice petrification). Often travel apart from their bonded.
- Wargs - Fauns who bond animals and use the bond to see through their eyes and control them. Generally spend the majority of their time in the safety of their home, relying on their bondmate to scout and hunt.
- Packbonded - Fauns who live side-by-side with their bonded, relying mainly on telepathy to match actions  

### Tyfs

Tyfs are more devilish in appearance, with sharp curved horns, and a long, arrow-tipped tail. They typically bond with sapients, most often dragons.

- Dragonriders - Tyfs who bond with (and ride) dragons. Gain elemental powers from their bond.
- Heartbonds - Tyfs who bond with another Tyf. Relatively rare - usually occur when two younger Tyfs are completely devoted to each other. Often wind up as adventurers or mercenaries.


## Shifters

Hermaphrodite Shapeshifters. Three distinct variants:

- Skinwalkers look vaguely human, and can shift into one (or very rarely two) perfect animal forms. Fairly advanced civilization, with an appreciation for the natural sciences.
- Fleshsculptors have pale, leathery skin, a vaguely reptillian face with solid black eyes (often more than two), and a body covered in spines. 
  They can shapeshift individual body parts as needed to adapt to any situation, but still retain the same broad appearance. Nomadic civilization. Make very good caravan guards.
- Proteans have a humanoid, amorphous shape with translucent flesh. They are able to change their shape and color to mimic the appearance of anything, but are not very strong.
  They live near water, in villages that blend in with the surrounding nature. Intelligent, but forgetfull - their thoughts are as mercurial as their forms. Even other kinds of shifters have trouble relating to Formshifters.

## Abyssals

Aquatic, live deep underwater. Old, very advanced civilization. Ancient hatred of dragons.
Telepathic and telekinetic. Can fly while out of the water, although only for short periods.

Dark skin, with bioluminescent highlights.
Octopus-like lower, half, althrough with only six tendacles - one front and back, and two on each side. Finned spine.
Two arms with three-fingered hands, and an extra set of double-jointed elbows.
Three short facial tentacles surrounding a toothed maw. One pair of eyes, with pale blue irisis and split pupils.

## Quorathés

Many-limbed arachnid/crustachean-like lower body, with a more humanoid upper body. Live in large, vertically distribitied towns, typically in rainforests.
At first glance, their face apears that of a normal human. However, their eye sockets each contain two eyes, they have pointed eards, and a seam 
runs from the middle of their lower lip down to the center of their chest. When they open their mouth, their lower jaw splits at this seam, revealing
a large vertical mouth lined with pointed teeth, and a two-foot tapering tongue.
Quorathés have twelve total limbs - one pair of humanlike arms extend from their shoulders, ending in hands with three long fingers.
Their remaining limbs are chitinous, with three segments, and end in short, three-clawed pincers:
 - One pair extends from the center of their torso.
 - One pair extends from the base of their torso, where a human's legs would normaly be.
 - The remaining three pairs are joined to their abdomen, starting right where the torso joins the abdomen.
The length and width of their limbs relative to their body varies greatly between individuals and towns. 
Some Quorathés are fluffy, while others are all smooth chitin.
Quorathés are very dexterous with their many limbs, and are excellent at multitasking.
They are also quite strong, and can comfortably carry ten times their body weight. When traveling, they often mount ornate, cart-like structures
atop their abdomen, filled with many comforts and possesions.

The Quorathés live on a different continent than the Bonders and Shifters, but sometimes travelers visit the main continent.

## Dragons

Many variants (and sizes). Main dragon species has a morphology similar to dogs, in that there are a lot of different varieties with unique traits that are all technically the same species (and can interbreed).
However, there are other draconic species, including drakes, wyverns, coatls, lindworms, and great wyrms (the largest and strongest species of dragon).

Highly intelligent, with their own language and history. 
Their claws are poorly suited to the finner trappings of civilization, and they have little need for tools, but they do build occasional structures. 
This is mostly limited to their lairs, which tend to be ornate and luxurious, but there are also a few communal gathering places build of cyclopean stones.

# Fauna

## Leviathans

Massive filter-feeders that drift on the surface of deep ocean waters, forming floating islands. Have a thick, chitinous shell, and many limbs (fins? tentacles?). Stable enough to build cities on. Very rarely submerge themselves for unknown reasons, which has led to (true) legends of lost cities.

# World

Exceptionally large world - big enough to support large numbers of massive flying apex predators.
The main sapient races only occupy a small portion of it, and dragonbonders often must travel to far away lands to find a dragon to bond with.
