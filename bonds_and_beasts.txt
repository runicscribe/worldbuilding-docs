## Elementals
Creatures of pure magic. Do not require a bond to cast spells (it may be more accurate to say that their entire essence composes a bond); 
can create immensely powerful effects, but only ones aligned with their nature. Rare, varying power levels.


# Magic System:

## Source
Power that fuels magic. Efectively endless.
Generally available, but some areas have more, and some have less.
Can be colored by local phenomena, which will affect the spells cast with it.

## Bond

Unshakeable conviction, virtue, or goal held by the caster.
To be able to cast a spell, must focus on this to exclusion of all else.

Without such a bond, spell will fail.

Generally a caster will have only a single bond
It is technically possible to change your bond, but this will significantly weaken your magic (since if you change your core convicton, its not much of a core conviction, now is it).
A particulaly traumatic or momentus event may cause a casters bond to change without notable change in strength (usually the new bond is a stronger conviction)

Nature of bond will color the nature of the spells cast with it, and may effect what magic you can actually perform.
Strenght of this conviction affects the strength of magic you can cast. Can also spend more time casting a spell to accomplish something more powerfull than you'd be capable of otherwise
All of the most powerful spellcasters are at least slightly insane, as to achieve such power they must have focused on a single conviction to the exclusion of all else.

Examples:

Relation with a person
Vow of Vengeance
Devotion to a deity

Some spellcasters use a physical focus (like a locket or holy symbol) to channel their magic - this can assist in focusing on your bond, but is not necessary to cast magic. 

## Casting Types

<Fire and Forget>
<Concentration>
Enchantment - Permanent rule, does not require concentration. Effectively alters reality, requires an equivalent spell to reverse. 
Usually simple localised stuff like "this sword will never dull", but rare powerful enchantments can affect all of reality.
