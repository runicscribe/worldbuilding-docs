# Gothic Fairytail world

Gothic aesthetic, but low stakes / low conflict.

Late middle ages architecture - tudor style houses, small villages and medium towns, knights, kings, princesses, etc.
Asian and Arabic styled towns elsewhere.

## Anima

A variety of sapient creatures ("anima"), usually unique in form and rarely humanoid.
Existance is typically a local legend among the humans, sometimes feared, sometimes revered.
Creatures generally know each other (at least those nearby) quite well, and occasionally hold gatherings.

Sometimes form friendships with the rare humans who wander into their domain and are polite.
Some are more well-known, as wise sages, but live in remote, difficult to reach places and only gift their knowledge upon the worthy.
Others claim rulership of cities or kingdoms (this is fairly uncommon, as most anima consider this a good way to get killed by some hero)

### Ur

Ancient cyclopean city, and refuge for the anima.

### Atla

Sister-city to Ur, but long submerged.
Meeting place for aquatic anima.
Council tower extends  (can extend?) out of the sea, used for meetings of all sorts of anima.
