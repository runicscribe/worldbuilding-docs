# Mythology

<TODO: Write up creation myth in balladic style, referencing eddas. Try and get 1 stanza per continent for section intros>

## Differences across continents

While this myth generally appears on every continent, who takes the roles of the heroes and vilains vary. 
The entity whose corpse forms the continent takes a prominent role in the myths of that continent, usually a heroic one.

In particular, the continent of Dragonsbones describes its origin thusly:

	The Gods and their Children marched on the Valley of Plenty
	
	As they approached the Dragon let lose a roar that shook the approaching Gods to their core.
	
    But the Archer was unbowed, and let loose an arrow which pierced the Dragon's breast.
	
    As the Dragon fell, it let loose a great gout of flame, charring the Archer's very bones
	

    From the Dragon's Scales sprang the first Kobolds, who inherited the Dragon's appearance, if not its stature.
	
    Where its Blood mixed with the earth came the Dwarves, a sturdy, hardworking race that shares a Dragon's lust for gold.
	
    The wild beasts that feasted upon its Flesh transformed into the ancestors of all the lands monsters
	
    The Dragon's Bones sunk into the earth, forming veins of Adamantine.  

## Pre-origin myth

The Atlanteans have their own myths which predate the godswar. While some details vary from group to group, the core events remain the same:

    In the beginning, the Cosmic Firebird flew through the Void.
	
    After an Age, it laid a single Egg, which in time split in two.
	
    In one half was Ymer, and in the other Mimur.


    The two halves quickly drifted apart, and Ymer and Mimur were seperated from each other by the Void
	
    Mimur soon bore four children, who had been concieved while the Egg was whole.
	
    While Mimur nurtured these children, Ymer was consumed by loneliness.
	

    In time <one> discovered fire, and build a great beacon
	
    <The other> began building a great <bridge? boat?> and eventually they were reunited.
	
    After Ymer and Mimur reunited, their children, used to being the sole focus of Mimurs attention, became jealous and slew Ymer while the two lay together.
	
    Mimur flew into a violent rage and was slain as well. 
	

    <One child> drank the spilled blood to gain Ymer and Mimurs power. After their belly was bloated with this blood, a great wolf ripped itself out of their body from between their legs, leaving behind a bloody hole.
	
    Even after it healed, this wound would again bleed every month, in memory of the injury
	
    <Another child> moulded the Atlanteans from the flesh of their parents.
	
    Later, a great dragon erupted from the earth that had absorbed the mingling fluids of Ymer and Mimur, and the four children fled back accros the <bridge/boat>
	

    <At some point, one of the four has has children with one of the new monsters>
	
    <The archer is the child of one of the original four>
	
    <The first four are the only humanoids>

    Eventually, the two haves of the work came <or were brought> back together, and the godswar begins.
