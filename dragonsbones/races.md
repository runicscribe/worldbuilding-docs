# Races

## Lineage of the Dragon

Races said to descend from the blood of the cosmic dragon.

### Kobolds

3-4 ft tall draconic humanoids. More durable then they look. However, they also act more durable than they are, so this kinda balances out.
Single-sex hermaphrodites, with internal genitals. Despite (or perhaps because of) this, Kobolds have a diverse range of social genders.
Lives in extensive cave systems, where they search for and hoard shiny things.

Society is a form of communal anarchy. Few rules. Little concept of ownership, hierarchy, or modesty.
Kobolds will often get swept up in an activity - e.g. a hunt, a feast, etc.
At the same time, individual kobolds tend to act with the community in mind. E.g. whenever making a meal, makes enough for a feast.
Its not uncommon for a kobold to get absorbed in a particular task, e.g making arrows thing for 5 hours in a row.

Good at large projects that mostly just nead a lot of labor, but not so much at those that need a lot of planning (science, complex engineering, etc)


Tend towards large groups - a community of less than 100 kobolds is rare.
Lone kobolds tend to appear somewhat lost, and are easily influenced.

Frequently in conflict with the dwarves, who they find to be stuffy and overly concerned with rules, but will put their differences aside to fight against the sylvans.

Kobolds ride giant insects (mostly beetles)


#### Southern Marsh Kobolds

Gecko-like, with more rounded features and a broad tail.
While conventional kobolds are durable in a 'tough' way, southern kobolds are more stretchy and flexible.

Cave 'bolds have a pale coloration and a translucent underside (neck, belly, crotch and tail).
Swamp 'bolds are more brightly colored

### Dwarves
3 1/2 - 4 1/2 ft tall humanoids. Stout and muscular - nearly as wide as they are tall. Both male and female dwarves are bearded.
Lives in underground strongholds where they mine for precious metals and gems.

Society is highly structured and stratified, with strong family bonds. It is assumed children will do the same job as their parents.
One unique thing is that there is no differentiation between male or femal social roles, or rather, Dwarven society has a single gender.
Frequently in conflict with the kobolds, who they find to be chaotic barbarians, but will put their differences aside to fight against the sylvans

## Lineage of the Archer - Sylvans
Centaurs, and Fauns/Elves, of the lineage of the archer. Often in conflict with the dragon-born races.

## Lineage of the Scholar

### Humans

Humans exist, but are from another continent and showed up relatively recently. Neutral, but not really trusted by anyone.

## Other Races

### Merrows

Coastal, amphibuous.


#### Faeries

Approx. 6-inch tall humanoids with four clear insectoid wings.

Skin is typichaly pale, but colorfull - light blue, light yellow, etc.
Rarely wear clothes. Normally can't speak, communicating through pantomime.

Rude, crass, and mischevious.
Constantly emit a bright glow. Can briefly intensify or dim this glow, but not extinguish it.
Can briefly turn invisible and intangible, but still glow.

Leaves behind fairy dust pretty much everywhere they go
Lay eggs which hatch into grubs, then metamorphise into adult faeries.

While they are not native to The Dragon, they can be found on that continent, and many others.

### Eldar

Humanlike in appearance, predating the godwar. Around 7 feet tall. Skin tones range from silver-blue, to gunmetal grey, to pale gold.

Along with the atlanteans, one of the only people predating the godwar that still live (though none remain alive who lived through that time). 
Survived by taking to boats, and are now nomadic seafarers, dwelling on great ships.
Possible ancestor of humans.

### Atlanteans

Deep aquatic people, living in sunken cities. Along with the Eldar, one of the only people predating the godwar.

### Automats
Mechanical Sapients. The only thing remaining that remembers the time before the Godwar. Typically eccentric.
Fairly diverse in form - some resemble centaurs, others have extra arms, but most still conform to a vaugely humanoid body plan.
Rare, but can be found on any continent.
