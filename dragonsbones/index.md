# Dragons Bones

World (continent) is said to be the corpse of an ancient cosmic dragon, slain in a ragnarok-like battle of gods by "The Archer", a Saggitarious-esque figure.
Many other continents that are the corpses of other dead gods exist, though only a handful are known. (Wolf+Man, death, Life/Plant godess, serpent?)

## [Mythology](./mythology)

From the dragons scales sprang the first Kobolds, who inherited the dragons appearance, if not its stature.
Where its blood mixed with the earth came the Dwarves, a sturdy, hardworking race that shares a dragon's lust for gold.
The wild beasts that feasted upon its flesh transformed into the ancestors of all the worlds monsters
Bones sunk into the earth, forming veins of adamantine.

## [Races](./races)

### Lineage of the Dragon

Races said to descend from the blood of the cosmic dragon.

#### Kobolds

3-4 ft tall draconic humanoids.
Single-sex hermaphrodites, with internal genitals. Despite (or perhaps because of) this, Kobolds have a diverse range of social genders.
Lives in extensive cave systems, where they search for and hoard shiny things.

Society is a form of communal anarchy.
Frequently in conflict with the dwarves, who they find to be stuffy and overly concerned with rules, but will put their differences aside to fight against the sylvans.

#### Dwarves
3 1/2 - 4 1/2 ft tall humanoids. Stout and muscular - nearly as wide as they are tall. Both male and female dwarves are bearded.
Lives in underground strongholds where they mine for precious metals and gems.

Society is highly structured and stratified, with strong family bonds. It is assumed children will do the same job as their parents.
One unique thing is that there is no differentiation between male or femal social roles, or rather, Dwarven society has a single gender.
Frequently in conflict with the kobolds, who they find to be chaotic barbarians, but will put their differences aside to fight against the sylvans

### Lineage of the Archer - Sylvans
Centaurs, and Fauns/Elves, of the lineage of the archer. Often in conflict with the dragon-born races.

### Other Races

#### Humans

Humans exist, but are from another continent and showed up relatively recently. Neutral, but not really trusted by anyone.


#### Merrows

Coastal, amphibuous.


#### Faeries

Approx. 6-inch tall humanoids with four clear insectoid wings.

Skin is typichaly pale, but colorfull - light blue, light yellow, etc.
Rarely wear clothes. Normally can't speak, communicating through pantomime.

Rude, crass, and mischevious.
Constantly emit a bright glow. Can briefly intensify or dim this glow, but not extinguish it.
Can briefly turn invisible and intangible, but still glow.

Leaves behind fairy dust pretty much everywhere they go
Lay eggs which hatch into grubs, then metamorphise into adult faeries.

#### Eldar

Humanlike in appearance, predating the godwar. Around 7 feet tall. Skin tones range from silver-blue, to gunmetal grey, to pale gold.

Along with the atlanteans, one of the only people predating the godwar that still live (though none remain alive who lived through that time). 
Survived by taking to boats, and are now nomadic seafarers, dwelling on great ships.
Possible ancestor of humans.

#### Atlanteans

Deep aquatic people, living in sunken cities. Along with the Eldar, one of the only people predating the godwar.

#### Automats
Mechanical Sapients. The only thing remaining that remembers the time before the Godwar. Typically eccentric.
Fairly diverse in form - some resemble centaurs, others have extra arms, but most still conform to a vaugely humanoid body plan.


## [World](./world)

Abundant in magic, with lots of natural 'biotech' - faerie (or mushroom, or jellyfish) lanterns, unnaturaly intelligent messenger birds, giant carrying a mobile goblin fortress on its back, instant-grow vines instead of rope, etc.
Kobolds ride giant insects (mostly beetles)

The Eldar and Atlanteans use more conventional technology, much more advanced than that of the younger peoples


Each continent is the body of some god.
Different continents are semi-independant realms, all in the same overarching world.
They are not connected to the seafloor, and drift through the sea independantly of each other, so relative positions vary.
This leads to a variety of different peoples encountering each other depending upon what realms are in proximity.
The sea has a faint luminesence at night.
Other continents/realms can be seen in the night sky, as black voids outlined in the glowing sea.
Instead of a sun, there is some glowing entity (creature? chariot?) that drifts through the sky.

### Haven-towns

Drifting continents can cause people to be left behind from their native continent, intentially or not.
Individuals generally gather together, forming diverse port-towns.
