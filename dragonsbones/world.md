# World

The world consists of many (over a dozen) mid-sized continents. Each continent is the body of some god.
Different continents are semi-independant realms, all in the same overarching world.
They are not connected to the seafloor, and drift through the sea independantly of each other, so relative positions vary.
This leads to a variety of different peoples encountering each other depending upon what realms are in proximity.

The sea itself is red, and wraps around itself like the inside of a toroid.
Instead of a sun, a great glowing firebird flies through the center of the toriod, resulting in a relatively normal night-day cycle.
The sea has a faint luminesence at night, which is more prominent near the coastlines of the continents.
As a consequence, other continents can be seen in the night sky, as black voids outlined in the glowing sea.

## Continents

There are over a dozen continents in the world, possibly many more than a dozen.


The known continents include:

### The Dragon

The primary setting of the world. Homeland of Kobolds and Dwarves.

### The Archer

The current nearest continent to the Dragon
Homland of the sylvans - elves, satyrs, dryads and centaurs.
Long emnity with the inhabitants of the Dragon.

### The Enemies

A unique continent comprised of a god and a wolf locked in death. The wolfs jaws are around the god's throut, and his sword pierces the wolf's heart.
Homeland of werewolves, 

Currently visible in the night sky from the Dragon.

### The Scholar

Currently visible in the night sky from the Dragon.
Homeland of humans.

## Cosmology

While the shape of the world is best described as the inside of a toroid, this isn't *quite* accurate. In some ways it is more like an infinite cylinder, in others more like the exterior of a toriod.
In reality, it is none of these, and cannot be truely described by normal geometry. However, it still does have several consistent properties.

As a reference point, the most common set of cardinal directions is based on the motion of the sunbird:
 - Sunward: The direction of the sun's travel. Also known as called Dayward, Duskward, or Sunce
 - Tailward: Opposite Sunward. Also known as Nightward, Duskward
If you were to stand facing Sunward, the remaining cardinal directions would be oriented as follows:
 - Dessward is right. Also called Dessins, Dessel, Deasil
 - Widderward is left. Also called Widdersins, Widder, Wuther
Either of these may be described as Riseward or Skyward.

From any given spot on the surface, the sea falls away to a horizon in the sunward and tailward direction. Above the horizon, the sky appears blue in daytime.
In both the dessward and widderward directions, the sea rises infinitely, fading from red to purple to a pale violet the further away it is. 


The riseward diameter, and total surface area is massive.
While the sunbird appears to move slowly through the sky, this is only due to its distance. Sailing sunward will only lenghen days slighly. If you keep a straight course, you will eventually loop around back to your home, bit it may take months or years.
Sailing riseward it will take many weeks or months to reach any continent you can see in the night sky, and many more to return home.

## Astrology

At any given time, about 6 continents can be seen in the night sky.
Which continents can be seen will be different depending on what continent you are on. As the continents move relative to each other, it is possible for each continent to appear in the sky (except of course the one you are on)
It takes about 30 years to see each continent this way. Movements are chaotic but predicable, order of appearance does *not* repeat every 30 years, but rather every 1000 years, with about 30 different sequences contained within these cycles.
