# Adventurer's Guide: Regional Customs and Dress

This chapter is intended as a guide for interacting with the various peoples of Dael. It mainly covers how you should dress and act to blend in with the locals, or at least get along with them.
Some groups are almost universally hostile, and in these cases it instead provides instruction on how to identify, avoid, or escape them.

## Eaos

The majority of Eoasians live near the Free Cities on the Great Eaos River or west of it, in the Elyos Republic. The savanahs east of the Great River are populated primarely by Daal'fae of various tribes. 
Further to the southeast is the Great Desert which is largely ununhabited. Past the desert can be found the the 'jinn Principalities. 

### Elyos Republic


#### Rural Elyos

#### Northern Frontier

#### Academy of Magical and Martial Arts

### Free Cities

#### Blackport

### Riftlander Cities

### Jinn Principalities

### Eaos Fae Communities

#### Daal'fae Caravans

#### Shapeshifter Commune

Strongly recommended you hire a 'fae guide, ideally from one of the local Daal'fae caravans.
You're unlikely to find many who speak any of the Eaosian languages.

Avoid the areas of the city decorated with purple-flowering vines, unless you are looking for sex and not too particular about who it's with.

#### Hyena Tribes

#### Lion Tribes

#### Independant Canine Groups

### Sach'ean Diarchy

Don't encounter outsiders often, and are suspicious of them.
The language of the Diarchy, Sacheal, is only spoken on the isles.
The only other language spoken here is Aelmon, the language of the 'jinn, and even that is rare.

Your best bet is travelling with a 'jinn or Enjat-Tehktun merchant ship visiting the Diarchy, as there'll likely be at least one interpreter among the crew.

### Enhat Tehktun

Poor and somewhat unstable.
Bring gifts or trade goods and you'll likely be welcomed. 

## Mhidda

### Futhern Dal

### Drakkar Clans

### Dhaigean Druids

### Northeastern Dhaigean clans

### Southwestern Dhaigean clans

### Hollow Cities

### Midh'fae

#### Wolf Clans

Isolationist, to the degree that you'll be unlikely to find them even if you are looking.
However, not inherently hostile.

If you are invited into their lairs, be ready for a very communal living situation and a lot of nudity.
Typically, a few clan members will know at least some Futhern, so that's your best bet for communication.

#### Mhidda Selkies

Fairly hospitable, hope you like fish, won't be able to access underwater enclaves.
Enough speak Futhern that you should be able to communicate if you at least know that language.

#### Dragon Teeth Selkies 

Very hard to get to, and not used to visitors. Bring trade goods - food and/or hunting implements. 

Language barrier - mainland selkie is your best bet for an interpreter.
Make it very clear you can't turn into a seal.

#### Ursine Fae

Mostly live alone, or in small groups.
Usually speak at least some Futhern.

Happy to have visitors for a brief time but not more than a few days.

Only real issue is they tend to live in rather remote locations.

## Kita Lau and the Shards of Xuon


### Shards of Xuon

Don't visit the Shards of Xuon if you can possibly avoid it. The Uon occupation and subsequent cataclysm has destroyed all social structures and stability, and the region still hasn't recovered.
The most stable regions are run by violent warlords, and the wilderness is exceptionally dangerous.

If you must travel through the region, your best best bet is finding a Xencha defiant enclave and hiring a guide from there. Though they are quite hard to find in the first place.

### Dragonhalls
Other Central Ael’Xhal communities

### Xhao’fae Villages

### Coastal Merfae

*Note on existance of Deep-sea merfae. If you can reach them, you've likely already got the resources and knowledge to get along.

### Quon Xi Colonies

## Quon Xi

Empire lays claim to whole continent, and part of Kita Lau
In practice, laws an customs mostly only reach Hearland and Valleys, and the closest of the Kita Lauan isles.

### Heartland

Southeast Coast
Southeast Inland

### Central Valleys

Central Mountain Valleys
Central Southern Valleys

#### Mountain Ascetics

### Kaldean Colonies

West Coast

### Northern Tribes

Northeast Coast
Northern Plains


### Queen’s Valley Druids
