# Arts

## Common Motifs

Midh patterns and geometry; carving, tapestries, tattoos. Often depict legendary stories and feats.
Futhern Dal tend towards more angular borders (even when not carved in stone), wheras the draisblodh, drakkar, and midh'fae artisans shape their works to more organic media.

## Statuary



Old Aeldar statuary is sculpted with ornate accoutrements. Fairly realistic in form, with some styilization (think egyptian statuary). Often painted, although as all examples are historical, this is no longer apparent. 
Also common use of bas releifs. 
Most of the remaining old Aeldar statuary is found in the Free cities. Modern statuary in the free cities typically consists of idealized depictions of historical figures - founders, war-heroes, etc., and may be made of stone or metal.
Second era Ael'daal use a wider variety of styles, with idealized human form and tasteful nudity more common. Modern depictions of mythologized Old Aeldar retain their archaic stylings. Painted staties remain common.
The Enhat-Tehktun hew fairly closely to traditional stylings.
Statuary is particularly common in the Sachean Diarchy, often depicting mythological or historical figures and events. Statuary in the diarchy is rarely painted; marble, sandstone, and bronze are common materials. Greek-style mythic nude figures are common here, 
The Elyos republic has less statuary, most of which is found in major cities, and generally depicts historical figures.

Djinn - statues of individuals are uncommon, and those that do exist are almost always larger than life. This is because most sculptors are earth djinn, who typically already have a statue-like form.
Statues of animals, or more stylized depictions (such as bas-reliefs, mosaics, or stained glass) are more common. Many styles derived from Old Aeldar forms. One divergence from Old Aeldar syles is they rarely use paint, instead using natural colors of materials.
However, given their control over elements, this still often produces a quite colorful result.

Thal. More often work in wood and metal than Eoasian Ã†l. Wood is painted or gilded, metal is typically left pristine. Occasional stonework varies - materials like jade left bare, duller minerals may be painted.
Mix of bas-relief and more three dimensional statuary. In the Quon Xi empire, statuary typicaly depicts religious and historical figures, the emperor, or mythical creatures.
Mythological figures often have exagerated features, whereas historical figures are more accurate but idealized.
Mythological figures are the only humans typically depicted in Western Thal statuary. 

Xhal - Stylized releifs in wood or stone. Sharper lines and flatter surfaces than the smoother bas-reliefs of jinn and Old Aeldar. Larger structured may incorporate the shapes of dragons or stylized faces.

Midh - Actual statuary is rare; biggest example is carvings of dead on stone coffins, moreso among more inland southern midh, a practice largely imported from the neighboring Eaos
The Dhagian Isles has a distinct artistic culture, and some statuary can be found in the southern cities.

Uon. Statues uncomon. Sometimes transmuted from flesh. Painting unheard of. Carvings and inlays common.

## Depiction of People

Some cultures have unique views on the depiction of people.

Among most nomadic Daal'fae, depictions of people are rare. While originally for practical reasons, this has bled into tradition as well.
In Quon Xi, depictions of living people are taboo (except for the emperor)
For followers of the Order of the Selfless, *any* depiction of people is considered taboo.

In Dragonhalls, anywhere dragons are depicted, humans are depicted smaller; as consequence most art of humans is smaller-than-lifesize

In the Sachean Diarchy, people are traditionally depicted nude in art, with clothed depictions being rare. The Wolf 'fae, Hyenid 'fae, Xencha Defiant, Chasmlight Merfae, Shapeshifter Commune, and followers of the Cult of Aphelia have similar traditions.
Conversely, nude depictions of people are taboo among the Eastern Mountain and Desert Daal'fae tribes, the Southern Dhaigean Ael, Southern and Dhaigean Drakkar, Futhern Dal, Hollow Cities and Quon Xi Empire.
Outside of these two extremes, practices are more varied. Among the Northern Dhaigean Ael, specifically athletes and warriors are traditionally depicted nude, with other figures being depicted clothed.

## Notable Cultural Signifiers

Among the nomadic Daal'fae, art must be small enough to carry, leading to a strong cultual tradition of textile art and jewelry. Many tribes also practice ornate body art - henna/bodypaint, tattooing, or even scarification.

Dragonhalls - Dragons are a common subject of art, and anywhere dragons are depicted, humans are depicted smaller; as consequence most art of humans is smaller-than-lifesize
