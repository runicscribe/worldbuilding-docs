# Arts

## Common Motifs

Midh patterns and geometry; carving, tapestries, tattoos. Often depict legendary stories and feats.
Futhern Dal tend towards more angular borders (even when not carved in stone), wheras the draisblodh, drakkar, and midh'fae artisans shape their works to more organic media.

## Statuary



Old Aeldar statuary is sculpted with ornate accoutrements. Fairly realistic in form, with some styilization (think egyptian statuary). Often painted, although as all examples are historical, this is no longer apparent. 
Also common use of bas releifs
Second era Ael'daal use a wider variety of styles, with idealized human form and tasteful nudity more common. Modern depictions of mythologized Old Aeldar retain their archaic stylings.

Djinn - statues of individuals are uncommon, and those that do exist are almost always larger than life. This is because most sculptors are earth djinn, who typically already have a statue-like form.
Statues of animals, or more stylized depictions (such as bas-reliefs, mosaics, or stained glass) are more common. Many styles derived from Old Aeldar forms. One divergence from Old Aeldar syles is they rarely use paint, instead using natural colors of materials.
However, given their control over elements, this still often produces a quite colorful result.

Thal. More often work in wood and metal than Eoasian Ã†l. Wood is painted or gilded, metal is typically left pristine. Occasional stonework varies - materials like jade left bare, duller minerals may be painted.

Xhal - Stylized releifs in wood or stone. Sharper lines and flatter surfaces than the smoother bas-reliefs of jinn and Old Aeldar.

Midh - Actual statuary is rare; biggest example is carvings of dead on stone coffins, moreso among more inland southern midh, a practice largely imported from the neighborin Eaos

Uon. Statues uncomon. Sometimes transmuted from flesh. Painting unheard of. Carvings and inlays common.
