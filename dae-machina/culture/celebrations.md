# Customs and Celebrations

## Convergences

Across Dael, all people celebrate the six convergences in some way or another, with the full convergence held in particular regard. 
The exact nature of such celebrations varies from culture to culture.

### Midyear convergence

The Uon cataclysm occured during the midyear convergence, so while in the past it may have been celebrated, this date has now become a day of mourning and remembrance for the nations most affected by both the Uon war and the 
cataclysm itself. These groups include: The Elyos Republic, The Free Cities, the Riftlanders, the eastern 'xhal of Kita Lau, and any surviving 'xhal who were native to Uon, as well as most dragons, 
as the cataclysm caused the largest number of Dragon deaths since the Dragon - Ael wars 5000 years ago.

Quon Xi, Western Kita Lau, Mhidda, and the 'jinn principalities were all affected much less severely by both the war and the Cataclysm, so mostly still celebrate this date.

### Elyos Republic

Week leading up to convergence - holiday, with grand feast following the solar eclipse.
Northern provinces hold parties around great bonfires throught the eve of the convergence.


### Daal'fae

Several major caravans plan their routes according to convergences, with a grand gathering spanning 13 days held annually in central Eaos
Opportunity to share news, celebrate, feast, and exchange members.

Other caravans mark the day, but do not celebrate it with such fervor, saving their revelries for the natural terminus of their respective routes.

The less nomadic predator tribes celebrate the great convergance with hunting and feasting, much in the way of the nomadic 'daal.

#### The Great Gathering

Spans the week preceeding and the week after the the full convergence, 13 days in total. 

This gathering always includes the Great Plains tribe and Center Inland tribe, as well as a number of smaller daal caravans that operate in eastern Elyos and near the free cities.
Every three years, the gathering also includes meeting includes Northern Foothills and Eastern Valley tribes. Individual groups may arrive late or leave early, as is necessary to stay on schedule, 
but everyone is at least present for day of convergence.

This gathering is an opportunity to share news and trade with other caravans, tell stories, feast, and generally celebrate a new year.
The relatively long period of time in one place gives the opportunity for a number of things not typically feasible while traveling.
In partucular, grinding grain into flour, building clay ovens for baking breads and other special holiday foods, and gathering wood for bonfires.
It is also an opportunity to building new wagons, for those caravans which use them.

The peak of the celebrations occur the day of convergence itself starting with moonset shortly before dawn and almost eight hours before the convergence.
The morning is primarly concerned with final preparations. The initial ceremonies, consisting of songs and storrytelling, start at noon and continue to convergence, just over one hour later.
The actual convergence is not visible from the great plains, as it takes place over the other side of the planet.
After convergence, feasting begins, followed by communal dancing and singing, continuing into the night. The celebrations reach their peak at moonrise, shortly after dusk. 
After moonrise, things break up into smaller groups, with celebrations continuing deep into the night.
Some especially persistant revelers try to keep going all the way through to the first moonset of the new year, just before noon of the next day.

### Xhal'fae


Rather than the lunar convergences, the main celestial events celebrated by the Xhal'fae are the lunar eclipses by the Darksun, which occur (...).
They used to celebrate the week surrounding midyear convergence, as that marks a period where the moons do not appear in the night sky, but this has somewhat fallen out of favor of late, particularly among the 'fae native to Xuon, 
as it now marks the aniversary of the Uon cataclysm.

### 'Jinn

All six convergences are minor holidays for the 'Jinn principalities, with the great convergence and midyear convergence both being of slightly higher importance than the others.


### Quon Xi and Kita Lau

Quon Xi cellebrates the renewal of the year for the two weeks following the great convergence. The actual day of convergence, marked by a total lunar eclipse, is a day of fasting and prayer.


## Tournaments

### Great Games of the Dhaigean Isles

Held every X years on ___, in the ancient crater of a darkstone meteorite.

Feats of athleticism and strength - races, wrestling, stonetoss, pole climb
Competitors are traditionally nude?

### 'Jinn Elementalism Competition

Formalized duels that are more public works of art than actual combat.

Group performances.


### Great Wyrm Games

Ball game with two teams competing for sport. Originally began in the Xerxes Empire, with the losers gifted to the dragons
Ran annually, with city level competitions starting in the second month the year.
Finals and Semifinals were held at Xerxes Capitol in the fifth month of the year.

After fall of the empire, many individual Cities accross Xuon and eastern Kita Lau continued to hold games, althoguh (mostly) without the dragon sacrifice aspects.

When the Xeres Reborn rose in the wake of the Uon cataclysm, they also brought back the more bloody aspects of the games, and added some twists of their own.
More conventional versions of the games are still held across eastern Kita Lau. In both cases, they span rather less of the year, occuring across 2-3 months in the middle.
