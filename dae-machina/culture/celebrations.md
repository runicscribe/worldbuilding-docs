The exact nature of such celebrations varies from culture to culture.

### Elyos Republic

Northern provinces hold parties around great bonfires throught the eve of the convergence.


### Daal'fae

Several major caravans plan their routes according to convergences, with a grand gathering spanning 13 days held annually in central Eaos
Opportunity to share news, celebrate, feast, and exchange members.

Other caravans mark the day, but do not celebrate it with such fervor, saving their revelries for the natural terminus of their respective routes.

The less nomadic predator tribes celebrate the great convergance with hunting and feasting, much in the way of the nomadic 'daal.

### Xhal'fae

Finals and Semifinals were held at Xerxes Capitol in the fifth month of the year.

After fall of the empire, many individual Cities accross Xuon and eastern Kita Lau continued to hold games, althoguh mostly without the dragon sacrifice aspects.

When the Xeres Reborn rose in the wake of the Uon cataclysm, they also brought back the more bloody aspects of the games, and added some twists of their own.
More conventional versions of the games are still held across eastern Kita Lau. In both cases, they span rather less of the year, occuring across 2-3 months in the middle.
