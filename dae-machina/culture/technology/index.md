# Technology

## Light

Mage-lights (objects enchanted to glow indefinately) are extrememly common, because they are easy to make, 
and often the first project of new or aspiring enchanters and artificiers (in the same way a blacksmith would have an apprentice make nails).

## Agriculture

## Heating and Cooling


## Travel

Primary method of land travel is by foot. (16 - 30 km / day, **20** km/day avg)
Due to their animal forms, fae on average travel faster - up to **50** km/day

Sea travel - relatively sophisticated sailing ships - 100 - 200 km/day
  Sea - 9 - 18.5 km/h;  100 - 200 km/day; **150** average
  Upriver 5.6 km/h; **60** km/day for major rivers, 15 - 30 for smaller rivers.
  Downriver 11 - 22 km/h ; **120** - 240 km/day
  
Some [beasts of burden](../world/bestiary/fauna/beasts_of_burden) are also used for travel, but mostly to carry goods, as they tend to be slower than just walking.
  
### Teleportation

Over any significant distance, requires some form of potent focci at both source an destination
(Specifically, a pair of sympathetically resonant items, e.g. two halves of a ten-thousand year glacial boulder, which must be transported to each destination without use of magic to retain potency)
As such, teleportation networks are mostly limited to large, well funded nations.
Paired portals are a little more common
Also some legacy systems by prior empires, but these are a bit risky / unreliable.

Mostly used for transporting important people and food (esp. during emergencies).
Damages sympathetic properties of raw materials, so cannot be used for transport of materials used in magical workings.
Drains stored magical energy.
Both these effects are only partial, but magnitude is proportional to distance and number of trips.
Does not significanly harm worked goods or enchanted items.
Long distance also requires a significant amount of magical power, so used sparingly.

Notable instances.
Networks:
 - Major cities in Eaos, including hollow cities (people and cargo)
 - Major cities in 'jinn cities, including hollow cities (people and cargo)
 - Major cities across Quon Xi Empire, extending into Kita Lau (people and cargo). This is the largest active network.
 - Smaller Eldar council network built on top of the remenants of various older networks. Hidden, and dangerous for unskilled mages to use (Mostly just Eldar councilmembers)
 - (Abandoned) Core Old Aeldar network. Built during the height of the first Daal Empire, about 800 years before the lich wars. Spans the Southwest Eaos Desert, from Eaosport to the 'Jinn cities. 
    The first major network ever built. Now partly destroyed, mostly abandoned, as majority of destinations have been consumed by the desert, and few people know how it works. Parts are still usable, but dangerous.
 - (Destroyed) Daal-midh Golden-age network, built about 1000 years before the Uon-'daal war. Connected 'jinn capitol, 'midh capitol, old 'daal capitol (now Eaosport), and a now-destroyed city on the southeast coast of Eaos. 
    Damaged by the Uon cataclysm, and now unsafe.
 - (Destroyed) Network between Eaosport, AoM&MA, and Teythmos; damaged in the Uon war during an attack on Eaos. No longer in active use, but a strong enough mage could still make it work for a small group of people.
Dedicated pair between AoM&MA and Teythmos

Clandestine pair between Blackport and Elgate

### Gliders

Non-magical, single-person flying machine used by the Xeres Empire, as a way of mimicing the powers of the dragons.
Constructed from wood and various light fabrics. Early designs were fragile and rather dangerous.

However, between the warm climate and many volcanoes providing strong updrafts, they could often be used to travel great distances. 

The technology was eventually adopted by the inhabitants of Dragonhalls. These designs typically use silk instead of plant fibre, but are othewise quite similar.
After the fall of the empire, Dragonhalls is the only place the technology has persisted. Modern designs often have some form of magical reinforcment, and sometimes other enhancements.

Dragonshalls also developed their own variant, consisting of a collapsible parasol/parachute on a two-meter pole, allowing safe descents from midair dismounts.

### Channel-trains

Magical Train system developed by the Empire of the Rising Sun, for transporting people and cargo medium-to-long distances, especially magical cargo that does not take well to teleportation.

Uses a chanelling enchantment to levitate the trains and eliminate most fricton.
Magical link to series of waterwheels and similar mechanisms to provide propulsion. 
Relatively high-maintentance.

 ## Currency
 
The cultures of Dae'machina use a wide variety of currencies.
 
Sustinence-based cultures mostly care about utility - does it have real value in and of itself.
Barter economies, grain, livestock, and similar are most common here.

Plain metal currencies lie in an interesting spot - they do often have intrinsic value, but a substantial part of this value comes from its magical capabilities.
With this comes many opportunities for counterfeiting - both mundane and magical. Magical counterfeiting is particularly troublesome, 
as transmuted metal is physically identical to natural metal, but loses much of its magical properties. Without a mage on-hand to test coins, such fakes are impossible to spot.

For this reason, while mid-sized nations may use regular metal coinage, many larger civilizations (especially those whose government's power is closely tied to the strength of its currency) 
use currencies specially designed to be difficult to counterfeit.

Examples include:
 - Raw or partly cut gemstones; the unique natural shapes are much harder to counterfeit than cut stones (multiple coins looking identical is an obvious tell)
 - Magically shaped currency, e.g. metal coin with a disconnected center part magically bound to the outer part - These reqiure too much work to be readily counterfeitable en-masse
 - Quon Xi uses a system of magically signed paper currency, which can be verified using enchanted spectacles.

For larger transactions, metal bullion or large gemstones is still practical, since at this level it is perfectly reasonable to have a mage on-hand to verify authenticity.

Civilizations where most or all members are somewhat magical (Fae, Jinn, Dragons) also have a different approach.
 - Jinn mostly use natural cut gemstones, as they can readily identify counterfeits by testing their ability to store arcana.	
 - Dragons don't really have a currency, instead operating mostly on favors.
 - Few fae societies have any form of economy. Those that do mostly use barter, although the Daal'fae caravans will keep a stock of Eoasian and Free cities currency, 
   selkies sometime use pearls and discs of abalone as a simple currency, and the lizad Xhal'fae of Kita Lau share currencies with their Xhal neighbors
