# Technology

## Light

Mage-lights (objects enchanted to glow indefinately) are extrememly common, because they are easy to make, 
and often the first project of new or aspiring enchanters and artificiers (in the same way a blacksmith would have an apprentice make nails).

## Agriculture

## Heating and Cooling

Magic methods are mostly highly efficient heat pumps or point focci, and are actually quite common. Basically all large cities utilize them heavily, as well as most mid-sized towns.
These devices tend to be simple and durable enought that they can be scavenged from old ruins, so even some smaller towns have may use a salvaged arcane heat system 

For more mundane heating methods, wood and charcoal burning is most used. Even wealthy individuals prefer cooking using mundaning heating methods due to the enhanced flavor.

## Communication

Magic: 
Paired scrying mirrors and sound crystals are most common. Multiply-linked exist, but are rarer and more expensive. Cheap ones may be always on, have poor range, and/or clarity.
Less common include linked journals (which or more of a luxury item, as they are expensive to manufacture, and run out of pages) or paired clay tablets.

Largest functioning linked broadcast system exists in the Empire of the Rising Sun.
Next biggest one is in 'jinn cities.

Direct telepathic communication may be used, but needs competent magic users who know each other on both sides, and is therefore only used between close friends and when extreme secrecy is needed.

Arcane constructs are sometimes used as couriers in areas with a particularily high concentration of mages, like the 'jinn principalities, hollow cities, or AoM&MA.

Mundane:
Foot couriers, or ships. Near free cities, 'fae couriers are prefered, for their superior speed.
Medium-short distances, or where cost is an issue.
Contracts, or other insances where a physical document is necessary.
Teleportation is sometimes used in such cases, but is not common. 


## Transportation

Primary method of land travel is by foot. (16 - 30 km / day, **20** km/day avg)
Due to their animal forms, fae on average travel faster - up to **50** km/day

Sea travel - relatively sophisticated sailing ships - 100 - 200 km/day
  Sea - 9 - 18.5 km/h;  100 - 200 km/day; **150** average
  Upriver 5.6 km/h; **60** km/day for major rivers, 15 - 30 for smaller rivers.
  Downriver 11 - 22 km/h ; **120** - 240 km/day
  
Some [beasts of burden](../world/bestiary/fauna/beasts_of_burden) are also used for travel, but mostly to carry goods, as they tend to be slower than just walking.
  
### Teleportation

Over any significant distance, requires some form of potent focci at both source an destination
(Specifically, a pair of sympathetically resonant items, e.g. two halves of a ten-thousand year glacial boulder, which must be transported to each destination without use of magic to retain potency)
As such, teleportation networks are mostly limited to large, well funded nations.
Paired portals are a little more common
Also some legacy systems by prior empires, but these are a bit risky / unreliable.

Mostly used for transporting important people and food (esp. during emergencies).
Damages sympathetic properties of raw materials, so cannot be used for transport of materials used in magical workings.
Drains stored magical energy.
Both these effects are only partial, but magnitude is proportional to distance and number of trips.
Does not significanly harm worked goods or enchanted items.
Long distance also requires a significant amount of magical power, so used sparingly.

Notable instances.
Networks:
 - Major cities in Eaos, including hollow cities (people and cargo)
 - Major cities in 'jinn cities, including hollow cities (people and cargo)
 - Major cities across Quon Xi Empire, extending into Kita Lau (people and cargo). This is the largest active network.
 - Smaller Eldar council network built on top of the remenants of various older networks. Hidden, and dangerous for unskilled mages to use (Mostly just Eldar councilmembers)
 - (Abandoned) Core Old Aeldar network. Built during the height of the first Daal Empire, about 800 years before the lich wars. Spans the Southwest Eaos Desert, from Eaosport to the 'Jinn cities. 
    The first major network ever built. Now partly destroyed, mostly abandoned, as majority of destinations have been consumed by the desert, and few people know how it works. Parts are still usable, but dangerous.
 - (Destroyed) Daal-midh Golden-age network, built about 1000 years before the Uon-'daal war. Connected 'jinn capitol, 'midh capitol, old 'daal capitol (now Eaosport), and a now-destroyed city on the southeast coast of Eaos. 
    Damaged by the Uon cataclysm, and now unsafe.
 - (Destroyed) Network between Eaosport, AoM&MA, and Teythmos; damaged in the Uon war during an attack on Eaos. No longer in active use, but a strong enough mage could still make it work for a small group of people.
Dedicated pair between AoM&MA and Teythmos

Clandestine pair between Blackport and Elgate

### Gliders

Non-magical, single-person flying machine used by the Xeres Empire, as a way of mimicing the powers of the dragons.
Constructed from wood and various light fabrics. Early designs were fragile and rather dangerous.

However, between the warm climate and many volcanoes providing strong updrafts, they could often be used to travel great distances. 

The technology was eventually adopted by the inhabitants of Dragonhalls. These designs typically use silk instead of plant fibre, but are othewise quite similar.
After the fall of the empire, Dragonhalls is the only place the technology has persisted. Modern designs often have some form of magical reinforcment, and sometimes other enhancements.

Dragonshalls also developed their own variant, consisting of a collapsible parasol/parachute on a two-meter pole, allowing safe descents from midair dismounts.

### Channel-trains

Magical Train system developed by the Empire of the Rising Sun, for transporting people and cargo medium-to-long distances, especially magical cargo that does not take well to teleportation.

Uses a chanelling enchantment to levitate the trains and eliminate most fricton.
Magical link to series of waterwheels and similar mechanisms to provide propulsion. 
Relatively high-maintentance.

## Currency
 
The cultures of Dae'machina use a wide variety of currencies.
 
Sustinence-based cultures mostly care about utility - does it have real value in and of itself.
Barter/favor economies, grain, livestock, and similar are most common here.

Plain metal currencies lie in an interesting spot - they do often have intrinsic value, but a substantial part of this value comes from its magical capabilities.
With this comes many opportunities for counterfeiting - both mundane and magical. Magical counterfeiting is particularly troublesome, 
as transmuted metal is physically identical to natural metal, but loses much of its magical properties. Without a mage on-hand to test coins, such fakes are impossible to spot.

For this reason, while mid-sized nations may use regular metal coinage, many larger civilizations (especially those whose government's power is closely tied to the strength of its currency) 
use currencies specially designed to be difficult to counterfeit.

Methods include:
 - Using materials that disrupt or resist magic, such as silver or darkstone. 
 - Using materials that cannot be transmuted for other reasons, such as starfire, diamonds, and other crystals formed in high energy environments. Such currencies are most valuable among magic-users.
 - Using currencies that are magically valuable, such as arcana infused items or soul-infused items (immoral – mostly used by necromancers). Again, such currencies are most valuable among magic-users.
 - Raw or partly cut gemstones; the unique natural shapes are much harder to counterfeit than cut stones (multiple coins looking identical is an obvious tell)
 - Magically shaped currency, e.g. metal coin with a disconnected center part magically bound to the outer part - These reqiure too much work to be readily counterfeitable en-masse.
 - Paper money with various anti-magic, anti-counterfeiting options:
   - Silver content
   - Special alchemical compounds, including ones that ignite when touched by magic, or those that produce some other special effect.
   - Sympathetic signatures (often blood, or a material from a very specific location)
   - Magically sealed – unreliable, since the sealer must be a stronger mage than any potential counterfeiters.
 - Barter

For larger transactions, metal bullion or large gemstones is still practical, since at this level it is perfectly reasonable to have a mage on-hand to verify authenticity.

### Elyos Republic

The Elyos Republic mints silver coins with various metal inlays for different denominations. This currency is also accepted by most merchants in the free cites and the Futhern Dhal.

Some northern merchants in the Empire deal in furs from the Wolf 'fae, which they pay for with various food goods that store well, and iron or steel weapons and tools.
Some southern merchants deal in spices from the Plains 'fae, which they pay for in glass beads, metal cart fittings, or other things the Plains 'fae find useful.

### Futhern Dhal

Most transactions among the Futhern Dhal use sized gemstones and gemstone dust, or bulk metal ingots for larger transactions, based purely on the value of the raw materials. 
Given that this is a value based currency, it is accepted by most larger institutions outside of the Futhern Dhal, but not by many smaller businesses that cannot readily handle raw gemstones.

Some strongholds also mint their own coinage, consisting of gemstones embedded a metal coin or token stamped with their mass.
The Futhern Dhal also buy furs and meat from the Midh'fae in return for high quality tools and weapons.

### Lost Cities ('jinn)

Since all 'jinn have at least some magical ability, they mostly use natural-cut gemstores, often infused with arcana. At the highest value tier is stabilized starfire crystals. 
Since this currency is mostly valuable to mages, it is generally not used outside the Lost Cities. For external commerce, the 'jinn usually use raw gemstones and minerals.

### Empire of the Rising Sun

The Empire of the Rising Sun prints a paper currency with a special alchemical formulation and sealed with royal blood. 
This currency can be verified using enchanted spectacles and is only accepted inside the Empire.

Outside the heartland of the empire a wide variety of less secure currencies are used, mostly various forms of coinage.

### Sach'ean Diarchy

Islands are small enough that counterfeightors are relatively easy to track down.
Currency is coins, made of nacre or electrum (gold-dominant), with a hole near the edge. Typically threaded onto bracelets or necklaces.
Higher denominations are embedded with gemstones or other inlays.

Range: 1600 : 1

Dup: 1/2 clip - Ass 1/4 clip

Bread 1 -> 1/4 clip
Modius 32 -> 8 clips
Pay 24 -> 6 clips / 1 Dirac


 - Clip: Smallest denomination. Narrow (1/3 cm x 3cm) bar of gold, with seven grooves. Cut to make change.
 - Shal: A flat oval or teardrop-shaped coin made of nacre. Worth about 5/8 of a Clip.
 - Tear: Small (0.5cm wide and 1 cm long), Irregularly shaped pearl. Worth 8 shals or 5 clips
 - Dirac: Small round gold coin, a little under <2 cm> in diameter. Worth 6 clips or 10 shals. About a day's pay for an unskilled laborer. <4 grams>
 - Pearl: Large (2 cm in diameter) round pearl. Worth 10 tears or 8 diracs
 - Rod: Heavy <250 g> rod <2 cm in diameter, 7.5 cm long> of gold. Infrequently worn, but often seen hanging in the shops of moneychangers or well-off merchants. Worth 64 Diracs
 - Drake: <3.5 cm dia> Coin inset with saphire or ruby. Only worn by the wealthiest
 - Sun: <4 cm> Coin inset with diamond. Worth 20 drakes. Only worn by the wealthiest.

### Other

Few fae societies have any form of economy. Those that do mostly use barter/favor economies, although some Daal'fae caravans will keep a stock of Eoasian and Free cities currency. 
Selkies sometime use pearls and discs of abalone as a simple currency, and the lizad Xhal'fae of Kita Lau share currencies with their Xhal neighbors 
Some Xhal'fae also trade in jewelry and ancient coinage found in ancient Aeldar ruins.

Dragons don't really have a currency, instead operating mostly on favors (though many do still hoard stocks of Ael currencies and other valuables).

## Science

See also [World: Science](../../world/science), for how things actually work.

Eaos and Empire of the Rising Sun are most developed in physical and chemical sciences (although the Futhern Dhal have the best metallurgy, and the 'jinn are pretty knowledgeable in that respect as well).
'jinn Principalities are actually quite far behind in this respect, given their infrastructure is almost entirely built on magic.
Xencha Defiant have some of the best non-magical medical knowledge in the world, especiually pharmaceuticals.

### Chemistry

Chemical knowledge is in a roughly alchemical era. Base elements and most chemicals are known, but are not well-differentiated

Mages typically care more about sympathetic properties of materials, which means that classification of materials and compounds is pretty extensive, but few other developments come from that avenue.

Mundane researchers also exist, and are the primary driver for more in-depth scientific knowledge.
However, the commonality of magic and how its expression is so often tied to passion means that apparent breakthroughs are more often caused by the (unknown) expression of latent magic, making consistent progress difficult.

### Physics

Kinematics and Thermodynamics are exceptionally well understood, translating to both magical and mundane breakthroughs.


### Medicine

Anatomy, diagnosis, surgery, theory of disease are well developed.
Mundane treatment methods and pharmaceuticals are quite primitive, but even a novice hedgewitch can make fairly effective magical treatments.

### Cosmology

Everyone knows Dael is the center of the universe, surrounded by a sun and three moons.
The learned are familiar with the darksun and outer planets, as well as the fact that these are composed some of the common elements.
Nature of the outer regions of the system is less well understood. Some (falsely) theorize there may be more planets / moons to far away to be visible, which embody other (non-elemental) compounds. 

### The Nature of Magic

No one has it quite right, although many have a reasonably close understanding.
Eaos is to preocupied with divisions between the 9 schools at expense of more mundane magics, 'jinn are too focused on elements, EotRS thinks everything can be perfecly ordered, and gives too much weight to celestial bodies.
