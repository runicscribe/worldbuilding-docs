Conventional healing magic is unable to regrow lost limbs, unless the loss was recent and the limb is still around.
Prosthetics, both magical and mundane, are used to fill this gap.

## Mundane Prosthetics

The most common non-magical prosthetics are things like hooks, false legs and similar; relatively cheap, but at least somewhat functional.
Those who opt for a more realistic-looking prosthetics (e.g., a finely sculpted false hand) will not get much functionality out of it. 
Even high quality functional prosthetics are fairly simple, with maybe a single point of articulaton hooked up to a spring.

### Wheelchairs

Spinal injuries are relatively easy to heal magically. Consequently, if someone doesn't have the use of their legs (but still actually has legs), 
they are probably either too poor to seek out a sufficiently skilled healer, or their disability is caused by a genetic condition.

In the former case, the person will usually use some form of mundane wheelchair.
In the latter case (assuming they have some wealth), there are a variety of possibilities, such as a finely crafted but otherwise mundane wheelchair, a levitating throne, a remote-piloted null construct, or even a magical exosuit

All this makes wheelchairs rather rare, but they do exist.

## Magical Prosthetics

### Cosmetic

Scars, missing ear, etc.
Relatively simple illusion.

### Sensory

Next simplest magical prosthetic after cosmetic. Either enchanted item, or direct enchantement on the host, to restore lost senses through persistent scrying effect.
May produce somewhat unusual sensory results. (which one is generally a mix of what the mage is good at, and whether or not the recipient wants to be able to turn the effect off. 

### Limbs

The height of prosthetic technology is custom-made magitech limbs crafted by a skilled artificier. 
Typically made of intricately wrought metal, these behave almost like a real limb, and may even incorporate an illusion making them look real as well. These are typically ludicrously expensive, and out of reach of most people.

From here, options become a bit more varied.

More basic artifice
Telekinetic / Ghost limb
Elemental limb
Chimeric limb, see below.


### Organ Replacement

Most internal organs cannot be effectively replaced through magic.
Skilled medical mages may be able to relace liver or pancreas functions by a complex transmutation enchantment, but that's about the limit - replacing something like the lungs or heart has too little room for error to be feasible.
Exeption to this is chimeric prosthetics (see below) and workings of powerfull archmagi or ascended.

Generally, you'll be more likely to find a mage who can turn you into an undying revenant than one that can fix a failing heart. 



### Chimeric Prosthetics

Only option that is alive and fully integrated into the hosts body.

Also pretty much the only school of magic capable of replacing important internal organs like lungs and hearts and such.

Typically shaped out of whatever biomass the chimerecist has around, so may look quite unusual, and have other side-effects.
