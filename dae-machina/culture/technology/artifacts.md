# Artifacts

Truly unique artifacts are quite rare.
Those that are were either crafted combination of superlative skill and pristine materials, resulting in a more effective version of something that exists, or are formed in moment of desperation, 
holding all or part of the creators soul and granting them a more dynamic set of abilities.
Many of the greatest magical workings are infrastructure, like the construct fields of New Aelmos or the near-impenetrable wards of the Academy of Magical and Martial Arts

## Great Artifacts

### Academy Hubstone

A massive crystal spire at the heart of the Academy of Magical and Martial Arts.
Shards of this stone are crafted into amulets for Academy graduates.

The crystal itself mainly notable for its size and purity, which makes it an excellent sympathetic focus, and allows it to serve as a long-range teleportation anchor.

### Monoliths of the Forsaken

A series of obelisks in the Great Desert, enchanted with immensely powerful encantation magic.

Most have similar construction, formed from igneous rock, and bearing a large darkstone crystal. Surrounding this crystal is a triple ring of gold, silver, and copper. 
Each obelisk is inscribed with magical runes and dire warnings, written in Old Aeldar.
A thick band of electrum runs down each side of the obelisk, joining it to its neighbors and forming a perfect circle comprised if nine obelisks in total.
Several such rings exist, spread across the Great Desert. The obelisks of each ring have somewhat varied designs, but these characteristics are shared.

The area within the circle is completely devoid of magic. Anything which enters is likewise drained of any magic contained within.
At the center of each circle is imprisoned a lich. Most often, this lich is entombed in what was the seat of their power, now fallen to ruin.

The majority of these circles were raised by Aktu, or other liches of the Old Aeldar Empire.
There are a handful of circles of unique design which were raised by other liches.

### Amulet of the Eternal Emperor

The Amulet worn by and holding the soul of the Emperor of the Eternal Sun.
It is a powerful artefact in its own right.

Magically shielded from detection
Protects wearer from scrying, and most magical attacks.
Grants enhanced charisma and limited foresight.

When dropped, anyone who sees it is compelled to pick it up and put it on, and in doing so is taken over by the Eternal Emperor.

### Cityseeds

Artifacts of immense power, capable of shaping an entire Futhern Dal cidatel-city out of a mountain. 
This is a slow process - while the seed holds a great deal of arcana, it must still gather more as throughout the process. 
The entrance and main keep are typically formed first, and take shape within a few months, but completion of the city still takes a few years.
Recharging the seed to a point where it can be used again takes several more years.

This is still much faster (and safer) than shaping such a city manually, even using magic.
 
3 Exist. There was once another, but it was lost before the creation of the Hollowheart seed.

The Futhern term for these artifacts is "Burgfræ"

#### Múrthell Cityseed

The first cityseed. It was created around 3,300 BC in the city of Múrthelberg, which was used as a template.
A bit flawed - cave systems and other voids in the host mountains can result in instability in some city sections during the shaping process.
While it has been used several times, only two of the resultant cities are currently inhabited. It has not been used in several centuries, and is currely part of the <> treasury.

Fist-sized diamond set near the top of a granite obelisk, inscribed with metal-inlaid runes. Requires magic to move.

#### Steinbörn Cityseed

More reliable than the Múrthell Cityseed. Still used, most recently 30 years post-catacysm.
City layout has lots of open space, with room for additonal construction after the shaping.
In this way, the various cities shaped by this seed are often somewhat different, despite having the same base layout.
It does also mean that one or more years of additional construction time after the shaping process is complete.

The cityseed itself was constructed concurrently with its template city, Försnið Citadel, in 2,800 BC. It took more than 100 years to perfect.

Technically consists of two seperate artifacts - a surveying tool used to help position the seed before starting the shaping process, and the seed itself.

The core of the seed is surrounded by a framework of interlocking rings and four adjustable feet, which are used to orient the city seed. The surveying artifact is mounted to this framework.
In the center is the seed itself - a thick square tablet of stone, metal, and crystal, about 1 meter across.

The full assembly takes up a 2m x 2m x 2m space, and weighs three metric tons, with the seed itself acounting for a third of the weight.
Generally transported in a large wagon. This full assembly is also known as the Steinbörn Sniðmat

#### Hollowheart Seed

The newest cityseed, created in 1,500 BC . Unlike the other cityseeds, both 'jinn and 'midh were involved in its creation.
As a consequence, it has some unique properties:
- It must be placed in the heart of a crystal vein in order to start the shaping process, which will be used to form the heart of the city - A pillar of quartz crystal with an illumination enchantment that mimicts the day-night cycle.
- Inscribes a variety of enchantments into the city as part of its creation process, notably the light pillar. The only enchantments created by the other cityseeds are for reinforcement.
- Produces an entirely subteranean city, like the other hollow cities. More vertical and organic-looking than other seed cities.
Used in the construction of three of the hollow cities, with a fourth currently being shaped.

60kg. Circular band of starsteel inscribed with gold-inlaid runes, with a massive diamond at is core. The inside of the diamond is inscribed with a replica of the shape of the city.
Can be placed and trigered by two people.

### Sword of the Protector

## Lesser Artifacts

### Uon Armaments

Relatively common, but bearing very powerful and resilient enchantments.
Not quite artifact status, but still hightly valued, even among other enchanted weapons and armor
