# Artifacts

Truly unique artifacts are quite rare.
Those that are were either crafted combination of superlative skill and pristine materials, resulting in a more effective version of something that exists, or are formed in moment of desperation, 
holding all or part of the creators soul and granting them a more dynamic set of abilities.
Many of the greatest magical workings are infrastructure, like the construct fields of New Aelmos or the near-impenetrable wards of the Academy of Magical and Martial Arts

## Great Artifacts

### Academy Hubstone

A massive crystal spire at the heart of the Academy of Magical and Martial Arts.
Shards of this stone are crafted into amulets for Academy graduates.

The crystal itself mainly notable for its size and purity, which makes it an excellent sympathetic focus, and allows it to serve as a long-range teleportation anchor.

### Monoliths of the Forsaken

A series of obelisks in the Great Desert, enchanted with immensely powerful encantation magic.

Most have similar construction, formed from igneous rock, and bearing a large darkstone crystal. Surrounding this crystal is a triple ring of gold, silver, and copper. 
Each obelisk is inscribed with magical runes and dire warnings, written in Old Aeldar.
A thick band of electrum runs down each side of the obelisk, joining it to its neighbors and forming a perfect circle comprised if nine obelisks in total.
Several such rings exist, spread across the Great Desert. The obelisks of each ring have somewhat varied designs, but these characteristics are shared.

The area within the circle is completely devoid of magic. Anything which enters is likewise drained of any magic contained within.
At the center of each circle is imprisoned a lich. Most often, this lich is entombed in what was the seat of their power, now fallen to ruin.

The majority of these circles were raised by Aktu, or other liches of the Old Aeldar Empire.
There are a handful of circles of unique design which were raised by other liches.

### Amulet of the Eternal Emperor

The Amulet worn by and holding the soul of the Emperor of the Eternal Sun.
It is a powerful artefact in its own right.

Magically shielded from detection
Protects wearer from scrying, and most magical attacks.

When dropped, anyone who sees it is compelled to pick it up and put it on, and in doing so is taken over by the Eternal Emperor.


### Sword of the Protector

## Lesser Artifacts

### Uon Armaments
