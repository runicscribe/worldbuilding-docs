# Warfare

## Magic in Warfare

While magic is not the be-all and end-all of warfare in Dael, it must be accounted for.
This may be done through use of war-mages, through enchanted armor and/or weapons, and through magical countermeasures such as darkstone or voidsteel.


## Military Structure

### Elyos Republic

Large, well-organized military. Maintaned in part through subsidizing education. Substantial Mage Corps.
Much of the rest is medium infantry.

### Free Cities

Most of the free cities field small military forces, focused on defense. They generally do double duty as guards and police.
Grandel and Vindel have larger ranger contingents to defend their extensive farmland.
Blackport retains independance through a substantial mercenary company.

### Ael'jinn Principalities

Nontraditional Military.
Primary fighting force is magical constructs, bolstered by a militia.
Given that all 'jinn are potent sorcerers, and there are few enemies near their territory, this is more than sufficient.

What inter-house squabbling exists is mostly political in nature, though the few times it has devolved into open conflict, it was mainly 'jinn fighting 'jinn.

### Futhern Daal

Each Futhern Daal citadel maintains a mid-size dedicated military, outfitted in the best 'midh-forged weapons and armor.
While these forces have few mages among them, all their gear is heavily enchanted.

### Quon Xi Empire

Very uniform and organized mage force skilled in group casting.
Similarly organized infantry force with many different specialized companies - archers, pikement, sappers, etc.

## Military Tactics




### Battlemages

### Fortifications

Even the walls of a small town will have some defensive charms on them.

Major cities have multilayered magical defenses, protecting them against mundane and magical attack, as well as blocking scrying, teleportation, etc.

### Siege Weapons

Channelers Mortar: Only the actual weapon is magical, projectiles can be most anything. Typically channels kinetic energy from a large weight to launch a projectile at extreeme velocity.
Typically large, bulky, and difficult to transpot - most common in defensive emplacements. Because they use mundane projectiles, most magical defenses don't do much against them.

Arcane Bombs - enchanted projectiles. Many variations. Can be launched through mundane or magical means.

More compact magical weapons also exist, but typically require some arcana source, such as infused gemstones.

Siege spells - actually requires casters, but can be adapted for the situation.
