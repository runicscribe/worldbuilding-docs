**Name:**

**Race:** 

**Appearance:** 
[Born 125 BC in the city of Armuth to a midh artificier-smith and a young daal battlemage.
Fought as a soldier right as the Uon - 'daal war began to get serious, from 108 BC - 97 BC. Leg was wounded in combat, and became a blacksmith for the war effort for another 20 years, until retiring to a small town far away 
from the fighting in 77 BC.] Continued to forge masterwork swords for officers in the war, and was somewhat renowned among swordsmiths of the time.
--
During retirement, was tempering sword for [?]
Small geoup of Bandits (mostly hungry war deserters) march into town. Leader demands village's food.
Smith grabs forge hammer confronts them, but is immediately backhanded by one of the bandits and knocked to the ground, injuring her badly enough that she can't immediately get back up.
Things go south from here. Village headman confronts bandit leader, who runs him thorugh. Smith finds a preternatural burst of strength grabs unfinished sword, still hot, and rushes the bandits.
Her body continues fighting long after she should have died, and once all the bandits were dead or gone, the sword lay atop her body, still hiltless, but honed to perfection.
--
While some of the other villagers were injured in the fighting, the smith and the headman were the only casualties.
Nearby soldiers show up an (hour? day?) after the fighting. Aghast at the carnage, help with cleanup.
Smith's son and apprentice (age 13) finds blade in pile of metal scrap after cleanup & finishes it in her memory. Takes it with him a year later when he goes to join the [Uon] war. Later takes it with him

Soul remains in the sword. Guides combat of wielder, but can only be wielded by effectively by defenders of the innocent. Otherwise will sabotoge your actions, usually at a crucial junction.
Telepathic, but not very talkative. Only speaks to a wielder she feels kinship with 

TBD: 
* Birthdate/Deathdate; What war is she a veteran of -> Either early Uon war ~100 BC, or daal-midh conflict ~2100BC
* Sword - origionally comissioned for who?
* Fate of village she defended - destroyed, but did everyone (anyone?) escape or not?
* First wielder - righteous or evil?

* [Queen of Ravens](./aeldar/queenofravens)

**Name:**

**Race:** Genderfluid Panther Xhal'fae

**Appearance:** 
Dark-furred feline fae with faint Jaguar spots. 
Shifts between male and female forms as expedient - sometimes to get an upper hand, somtimes just because they feel like it.
Many members of the criminal underworld think they are actually brother and sister.

Normally wears a wide leather belt around their waist, with daggers, poison, lockpicks, and various other tools, and nothing else.
Occasionally sports a pair of bracers or anklets if they need to carry more.

Assassin and high-end mercenary - murders, heists, etc. Doesn't do guard duty. Mostly in it of the thrill of the hunt. 
Highly compettitive in all aspects - this extends to negotiating payment, and as a consequence they have ammassed quite a fortune. 
Not wanting the hassle of managing this coin, they've hired stewards to take care of assets and maintain safehouses across most of the Free cities.
This has only caused their fortune to grow, even with a generous percent going to their stewards. A couple have gotten greedy, and regretted it. 
No one else has made the same mistake since news about what happend to them spread (the first one eaten alive, the second subjected to death by 1000 cuts over the course of a week, with his parts spread throught the city).

Parents were displaced from Quon Xi by the Uon war and resulting cataclysm. Born in the shapeshifter city. 
Parents returned to Quon Xi, they made there way to Blackport in their early teens

**Affiliations:** Blackport, Free Cities
