# Ã†l'xhal

(Aztec-Indonesian)
Dark to olive skinned. Brown, blond or copper hair (Curly or wavy). Brown, green or amber eyes.
Tribes and settlements throught the Southern Archepelago.

Settlements tend to be small, and integrated with the surrounding jungle, but quite advanced.

The 'xhal are descended from ancient Aeldar and modern 'thal. 
They have relatively benign relations with the dragons of the isles.
They have a rather more adversarial relationship with the Xhal'fae, many of whom have few
reservations hunting stray 'xhal as food.
