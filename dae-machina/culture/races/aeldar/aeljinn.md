# Æl'jinn

The Æl'jinn are a race of elemental shapeshifters. Similar to the
Æl'fae, they originated from an Ældar offshoot that primarily
practiced elemental magic circa 1,000 BC. Early Æl'jinn were naturally
skilled at elemental magic, and often took elemental familiers. Over
the course of many generations, the the magical skills of the Æl'jinn
gradually became natural talents. The most prominent of these is the
ability to transform their bodies into elemental forms. Modern Æl'jinn
are humanoid, with strong elemental abilities and the ability to shift
all or part of their form into some element. Most 'jinn retain a
part-human, part-elemental form. Æl'jinn are highly intelligent, and
very long lived. While their human form ages at a slightly reduced
natural rate, 'jinn do not age in their elemental form. Consequently,
elder 'jinn tend to spend more and more time in their elemental forms,
to the extent that the oldest 'jinn are always in their elemental form.
Half-jinn, and other weaker 'jinn who cannot shift into a full
elemental form die of old age at about 100 to 200 years.
Their are four main 'jinn subraces, originating from the four founding
families of the original Ael'jinn and representing the four classical
elements: Fire, Air, Water, and Earth.

Æl'jinn can only reproduce in their human form (and as a consequencecan only do so in their first 100 years or so of life).
Rarely, two elder Æl'jinn who have lost the ability to shift back to human form may permanently merge their forms, effectively
creating a new individual with all of their memories.

Ael'jinn ascribe a great deal of meaning to their lineages, and maintain detailed family trees stretching back to the time of the founding High 'jinn families.

## Fire 
Fire 'jinn have black, auburn, or red hair. Their hair often
incorporates perpetual flames. Their skin color ranges from black, to
brown, to reddish brown. Their irisis are blue, purple, red, or amber.
Fire 'jinn clothing tends to be minimalistic, and primarially composed
of metals and other fireproof materials such as salamander leather or
(rarely) dragonhide, although their clothing also often incorporates
cloth tassels. They also tend to wear lots of jewelry, often
incorporating diamond, ruby and/or quartz.

## Air
Air 'jinn have blonde, silver, or white hair, pale tan or light
blue skin, and blue or grey irises. Air 'jinn clothing is primarily
comprised of ornate layered robes, usually with tassels and ribbons
that will float dramatically in the wind. 

## Water
Water 'jinn have blond, brown, or red hair, tan skin, and green
or blue irises. Water 'jinn clothing is minimalistic and often
diaphanous. It is usually comprised of cloth that dries quickly. Water
'jinn jewelry often incorporates ocean products such as pearl, abalone,
and coral.

## Earth
Earth 'jinn have brown or black skin, brown or black hair, and
green, blue, or amber eyes. Male earth 'jinn are often bald, or wear
their hair very short. Earth 'jinn generally wear ornate robes or
togas. Unique among the 'jinn, earth 'jinn retain a humanoid shape when
fully shape-shifted.

## Hybrids
In addition to the four founding families, there are a number of other 'jinn sub-races and hybrids.
Shadow 'jinn shapeshift into a black smoke that absorbs ambient light.
They have a natural affinity for air and fire. Shadow 'jinn are usually
dark skinned. 
All shadow 'jinn belong to a single extended family originating from the first 'jinn, and as such are rather rare.
Sand 'jinn shapeshift into a cloud of sand. They are most common in
desert regions, and have a natural affinity for earth and air. Most
sand 'jinn are indistinguishable from earth 'jinn in their human form.
Storm 'jinn shapeshift into thunderclouds, and air capable of
projecting rain and lightning. They have a natural affinity for air and
water, and are about as common as any of the four founding 'jinn
families. Storm 'jinn are most similar to air 'jinn in appearance, but
may have darker coloration.

The offspring of 'jinn of two different types may manifest one of the elements of their parents, or may have a hybrid form.
Magma 'jinn originate from earth and fire 'jinn, and can transform
their body into molten rock of varying temperature. Magma 'jinn are
fairly rare
Clay 'jinn originate from earth and water 'jinn, and can transform their body into mud or clay. Clay 'jinn are quite rare.
In addition to being a 'jinn sub-race in their own right, storm 'jinn
can originate from air and water 'jinn or from fire and water 'jinn.
Similarly, sand 'jinn can originate from earth and air 'jinn parents.
Pyroclast 'jinn can shapeshift into hot, noxious smoke, and are the
descendants of air and fire 'jinn. They are somewhat similar to shadow
'jinn.

### Celestial 'jinn
Celestial 'jinn have an affinity for three or more elements (High
Celestial 'jinn have an affinity for all four of the classical
elements). Celestial 'jinn shapeshift into a cloud of smoke and dust,
interspersed with lightning, crystals, and small glowing balls of
plasma. Their precise attributes vary depending on their elemental
affinities. Celestial 'jinn almost always remain in a half form, with a
humanoid torso, and a pillar of smoke in place of their legs. Celestial
'jinn are uniquely well-suited to countering the abilities of other
'jinn due to their larger range of abilities. The ofspring of celestial
'jinn are almost always also celestial 'jinn, regardless of the
elemental affinity of their other parent.



## High 'jinn

The few Ael'jinn older than 2500 years are coloquially refered to High 'jinn.
These 'jinn originate from the original Aeldar civilization, from before the Lich wars.
As such, their human form is somewhat different in appearance than modern 'jinn, looking much like the old Aeldar.
Furthemore, they do not actually have natural shapeshifing abilities, shifting solely due to their own magical ability.
This means that they do not have the same aging constraint as modern 'jinn, 
and can freely shift between human and elemental form despite being over 2000 years old.
Their great age also typically means they have accumulated a great deal of knowledge and magical power over the aeons, 
and often have a variety of unique abilities.

Many High 'jinn serve as leaders among the 'jinn communities.


## False 'jinn

"False Jinn" are shapeshifters that most Ael would consider to be 'jinn, but are not considered as true 'jinn by the Ael'jinn themselves.

### Woodborn

Woodborn are elemental shapeshifters with an affinity for trees and plants. They are sometimes confused for dryads.

They are magically most similar to 'jinn, and as such are commonly classed as such. 
However, philisophically they are closer to 'fae. They also predate the origin of the 'jinn by a couple millenia, starting as nature shamans much like the 'fae, but gravitating more towards plants than animals.
Througout the ages, they have consistently been relatively rare, especially since they have a tendancy to permanently become "one with the forest" later in life.

Over the milenia, practicing groups have died out, falling to conflict, cataclysm, or ennui (baring a handful of ascended that still retain something resembling a human mind)
One large group of woodborn used to inhabit the Great Northwest forest of Mhidda, but the lack of other Ael civilization gave them no real reson to remnain in human form, and they all gradully melded with the forest.
Even now, the northern Ael believe these woods have a mind of its own. 

There are only two remaining woodborn lineages - a small group scattered across the shards of Xuon at the northwest edge of the Riftscape, and larger group throughout northwest of Quon Xi.

### Ester's Lineage

Εσϑερ (Ester) was an adventurous & magically inclined water 'jinn ~ 1500 yrs ago.
Travelled Eos. Spent time among High'fae remenants.

Sired a new 'jinn (or 'fae) variant - Ester's descendants appear similar to water 'jinn at first glance, 
but actually shapeshift into a unique variety of Ooze. They can change color at will, and secrete a powerful acid. 

Often, when appearing in human form, are still technically ooze-like in substance, just reshaped and colored accordingly.
This ability also allows them to mimic the form of others, but this is only really good for fooling visual inspection, 
as their skin still gelatinous, and they don't smell like a normal human.

Like most 'jinn, they are effectively immortal.

Because they technically shapeshift into a creature, some consider them to be 'fae rather than 'jinn, even if their abilities
are more like that of a 'water jinn than any 'fae.

Like Oozes, they are capable of reproducing asexually through fission.


# Culture

Since all 'jinn are powerful elemental mages, many things that would be
accomplished by other races using technology are accomplished solely by
magic by the 'jinn. Heat and light are provided by eternal fire and/or
magma. Heavy lifting, mining, smithing, and architecture are all
accomplished by the magic of earth-aligned 'jinn. Water, Ice, and
weather 'jinn manage plumbing, refrigeration and climate control. The
only conventional technologies 'jinn employ are related to art, farming, and 
textiles. Most 'jinn cities are found in mountainous or volcanic
regions due to the mix of elements &#8211; Air, snow and ice at the peak of
the mountain, stone thorough, and in the case of volcanic mountains
fire and magma at the core of the mountain.

## Eastern 'jinn

Isolationist, although not entirely by choice astheir prefered enviroments are frequently dangerous to other races.
This is excacerbated by the large desert seperating the Eastern 'jinn cities from the other population centers on Eos.


Sprawling, highly ornamented cities tailored to their unique phisiology. Some of these, such as the capitol, are designed to be 
hospitible to all varieties of 'jinn. This often necessitates at least some degree of comprimise, so there are also cities (typically somewhat smaller)
that are built for only a single type of 'jinn. These are often dangerous other varieties of 'jinn - some are built deep other the ocean, and at least one is found in the caldera of an active volcano.
All 'jinn cities still do have regions that are hospitible to natural humans, in order to provide a safe place for younger 'jinn who do not yet have full control over their abilities.
These districts also often serve as trade hubs. 

Outside the borders of these cities stretch sprawling farms, tended primarly by golems.
Much like the 'jinn themselves, the exact nature of farms varies, ranging from terraced mountansides and sprawling fields of grain 
to watterlogged rice paddies and seaweed beds, to subteranean mushroom farms, and more, depending on the location of a specific city.
The city outskirts also include grazing areas for a variety of livestock.

'Jinn families live in multigenerational villas, built up over the course of millenia.

Occupations:
Magical and scientific research, although this tends to be esoteric or theoretical rather than practical
Philosophy. 
Art. Cities are highly ornamented.
Gollemancy & Agriculture
Politics

In the past, the more adventurous 'jinn formed groups to clear out remanants of the lich war from the desert, but in the last few centuries, 'jinn who were so inclined instead fought with the 'daal in the Uon war.
More recently, expediotions into the desert have again started up, but now there are also groups that are trying to stabilize the edges of the riftscape.

## Hollow cities

Much more multicultural, and more comprimising in their environment.
e.g. the home of a Fire Jinn may be fireproof, and have a special room with a lava pool for relaxation, 
but otherwise would be entirely hospitible to non-'jinn guests.

Live among variety of other races, and have adapted many aspects of their culture.
Since hollow cities are underground, and the 'jinn are pivitol in their stability and upkeep, a large proportion of hollow-cities Earth'jinn are effectively laborers, 
excavating new areas, reinforcing exiting ones, etc.

Fewer philosophy and art are less common occupations than among eastern 'jinn, and researchers tend to have a more practical bent.

## Quon Xi 'jinn

There is also a small number of 'jinn spread across Quon Xi, although mostly found in the western regions.
These are mostly particularly adventurous Air and Water 'jinn, and their descendants. A large proportion of these are wanderers, travelling from place-to-place. 
Others have settled down in mostly 'thal settlements. There are a small number of established 'jinn settlements on the continent, but they are not common, and are quite isolated.
