# Dragons

Dragons look like large winged lizards. They have a long neck and even longer tail, four legs and and a pair of batlike wings. 
Their front legs can also serve as arms, and their back legs are digitigrade. Each of foot has three front toes ending in long talons, plus one opposable claw. Their wings have for finger struts, plus one semi-opposable claw.
They have a long mouth full of needle-like teeth. They have a narrow nose with side-mounted nostrils. Their eyes are large, slitted, and forward-facing. They have internal ears behind and below their eye level. Most dragons have a head surrounded with spines and horns, most prominant at the base of their jaw and behind their brows.
Their chest is quite deep, consisting primarily of wing muscles, with a much more narrow lower torso.
Most dragons also have spikes or ridges running down the length of their spine, from the base of their skull to the tip of their tail.

Female dragons are on average 20-25% larger than males.

Dragons are sapient, and tend to be quite intelligent. All dragons have a tendency towards hoarding, although individual dragons will hoard different things. Many dragons hoard gems, gold, or wealth, but others may hoard magical artifacts, art, or knowledge. Dragons have their own spoken language, but can often speak and write in a variety of human languages. Many dragons are philosophers and researchers, devoting a great deal of time to unraveling how some aspect of the universe works. There have also been a number of dragon warlords and conquerors who have taken over local human civilizations over the ages, although these have generally limited their conquests to within their own territories. Since dragons are solitary and have an extremely low population density, there is no real dragon civilization, although some dragons have contributed to the success of certain human civilizations.

Because of their size and large appetite, dragons tend to be solitary, with territories ranging in size from 20,000 to 100,000 square kilometers (this is equivalent to a circular region with radius 80 to 180 kilometers). As a consequence, the global dragon population is around 1000 – 3000 dragons. Dragons will sometimes form agreements with the humans living in their area, usually something along the lines of the dragon not attacking their cities in return for a regular tribute of meat. Dragons usually eat large herd animals such as deer or sheep, although they may eat humans if given cause to. 

All dragons naturally have access to an imense amount of magical power. Most dragons are also skilled sorcerers, and often use magic to appear to “breathe” elemental blasts like fire or ice. Their magical nature also assists in their ability to fly. Some dragons can shapeshift into a human(like) form. When they shapeshift, they retain their mass (with a corresponding increase in density), and much of their original strength, as well as all their magical abilities. Due to the complex nature of this transmutation, it takes rather more time (around an hour) than conventional shapehifting.

Some dragons use their magical strength to petrify foes. These dragons are someties refered to as basilisks (or gorgons if they take human form).

## Dragon Subraces:

Dragon's typicaly present as one of five races, listed below. Note that these are not distinct species, and can (and often do) crossbreed. Consequently, some dragons may have a mix of traits.



### Gold / Horned / Plains Dragon

Plains dragons are the largest race of dragons. They average 25-45m long and 5-9m at the shoulder, with a 1.7-3m long head.
Their head has a pair of large, slightly curved horns, prodruding from the back of their head, and their jawline is lined with a row of smaller spines.
They have long hind legs and broad, raptorlike talons.

Plains dragons are found in mountain and cliff regions near savannah and plains, where they hunt large mammals.  They are gold, bronze, or copper in color.


### Red / Plated / Mountain Dragon

Mountain dragons average 20-40 m long and 3.3-6.6m at the shoulder, with a 1-2m long head.
Their head narrows to a vertical ridge at the front and has a single, diamond-shaped armor plate on top.
They have a long neck and tail and a bulky torso and legs. 
Their hide is covered in large, interlocking armor plates, especially along the neck, spine, underbelly, and tail. The legs are covered in smaller scales, and the wings are broad and leathery. The tail of mountain dragons tends to be broad and has an enlarged/swolen tip.

Mountain dragons are generally some combination of red, orange, grey, or black in color, with a darker spine and lighter underbelly and wing membranes.
Mountain dragons prefer to live in steep, rocky mountains, caves, and volcanic regions. Compared to other dragons, mountain dragons are relatively poor fliers, but very good at tunnelling.


### Green / Western / Forest Dragon

Forest dragons are small (for a dragon), but have a long, serpentine body. They average 15-30 m long and 2.5-4.75m at the shoulder, with a 0.9-1.7m long head.
They usually have two pairs (four total) of antler-like horns on the back of their head, and a rounded snout. 
Forest dragons have a long wingspan, but relatively narrow wings. Their body is covered in small scales, with larger plates on their underbelly. They often have a feathery mane and tail.

Forest dragons tend to be brightly colors, and are usually green, red, blue and/or gold in color, often in a mottled pattern.
Forest dragons are primarily found in rainforest regions on the western continent and the Xhal isles. They generally hunt medium sized rainforest animals (deer, pigs, monkeys) and will also catch fish. Like tundra dragons, they are capable swimmers.

### Blue / Spined / Valley Dragon

Valley dragons are on the smaller side; 10-28m long and 2-6m at the shoulder, with a 0.7-2m long head. 
Their head is framed by three or more pairs of curved similarily sized horns, and their tail ends in a curved blade.

Valley dragons are puple, blue, black, or silver in color. They prefer jungle and forest regions, although they can also be found in cliffs and canyons, often with a brown or tan coloration. They are equaly comfortable moving in the sky or on the ground, where they move with a feline grace.

### White / Finned / Tundra Dragon

Tundra dragons are similar in size and appearance to spined dragons, but stouter, bulkier, and with shorter, straighter spines and horns. They average 10-25m long and 2.6-6.3m at the shoulder, with a 0.7-1.75m long head.
Like spined dragons, they have three or more pairs of horns framing their head, but their horns are straight, flat, and broad.
Tundra dragons have paired spines running the length of their body, which become in a pair of horizontal, webbed fins at the end of their tail.

Tundra dragons are white, blue, or grey in color. They frequent arctic and tundra regions, as well as remote, rocky islands. They hunt a variety of aquatic animals.


Hunts elk, reindeer and occasionally aquatic mammals.
