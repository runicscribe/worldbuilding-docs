# Sprites

Sprites are 4 to 6-inch tall humanoids with insectlike wings. 
There are three major sprite sup-races, which are primarily distingushed by their wings (and coloration):

* Butterfly/moth winged (coloquially refered to as faeries)
* Dragonfly-winged
* Wasp-winged.

All sprites have digitigrade feet, with long clawed toes. Their forearms and lower legs have stiff, carapace-like skin, with segmented digits. Both their hands and feet have three digits, with two pointing forward and one oposing.
Sprites have faceted monochromatic eyes, long pointed ears, and a pair of antennae. Their hair is stiff, and vaugely resembles primitive feathers.

They are short lived, clever, but not highly intelligent (ie. Good ‘street smarts’ poor ‘book learning’). Natural habitats are bogs, swamps or marshes. Many sprites make their home in human cities as messengers, spies, and other jobs related to their unique physiology.

Traditional sprite clothing is made of insect carapace, leaves and petals.
More modern methods incorporate fine silks, and occasionally rare and delicate skins (eel, snakeskin, mouse).

Sprites are disproportionately strong, capabale of lifting objects many times their body mass. However, they can only carry a little over their own mass while flying, so most of their equipment is still quite light.

Sprites natural magical tallents tend towards illusion, mental magic, and telekinesis/object manipulation. Despite their small size, skilled sprite telekinetics are just as powerfull as a comparable Aeldar mage. Necromancy is also fairly common among wasp-winged sprites. Sprite mages tend towards innate sorcery-style magic, with wizards being extreemely rare.

## Biology

It is largely agreed that sprites are the result of some wizard expirment, although no one quite knows when they were created or by whom. While they mostly look like tiny humans, their actual biology is much more insect-like.

Sprites are quite short-lived. They reach adulthood at 4 years (with the first three years spent in a larval form), and old age at 11. Sprites rarely live past 16.

Sprites are only fertile for 5 to 7 years after reaching maturity. They are sexually active for 1-3 weeks each year in late summer, when the congregate in swarms to mate. Up to a week after being inseminated, female sprites lay 100-300 eggs (exact location varies between groups, often the underside of a leaf or in rotting organic matter). Eggs are left unnatended and hatch into larvae within one week. After a just over 3 years, in the early spring, the larve pupate, and emerge as juvenile sprites a few weeks later.

Socially, sprites have no real family structure. Mating does not result in any continuous relationship, and parents rarely know who their children are. The only significant social bond sprites form is between siblings that survived larval stage.
