# Daal'fae History

## 10,000 BC: Prehistory

The Daal'fae are the oldest of the 'fae bloodlines, predating the first Ã†l'daal Empire.
Originate from shamans of early hunter-gatherer groups, with animal familiars.

Shamans from nearby groups kept in touch, and often exchanged children during apprenticeships
Shapeshifting a rare and difficult skill practiced by only a few
These practices eventually developed into formation of shaman groups.

Hunter-gatherer tribes still had their own magic users, but now were also communities made up solely of magic users.
Shapeshifting became a more common talent as these groups shared knowledge and skills among themselves. 


Initially, these groups were primarly around south-central Eaos, along (now deslolate) ... River
Common affinities included:
    - Antelope
	- Hyena
	- Lions
	
As Ael gradually expanded northwest, a somewhat isolated splinter group formed, near where what is now the AoMMA.
Given the differing climate, these groups had affinities with different groups of animals.
  - Elk
  - Wolves
  
Area that is now AoMMA was frequent meeting place of early shaman groups of this splinter group.

Sometime before the Dragon wars, a large group of northern 'fae precursors managed to cross the Dragonspine mountains, forming the precursors of the Deep Fae

Other northern fae expanded southeast, forming precursors to most deer fae.

In parallel, the more southern 'fae groups began demonstrating the hybrid human-animal forms that are now common among the Daal'fae, in addition to regular shapeshifting abilities.

## 5000 BC: Dragon Wars 
 
Least impacted by Dragon Ael wars

Main consequence is that there's much fewer Ael'daal in central and NE eaos (aside from Ironfire citadel)
Many groups take in remaining Ael'daal survivors, naturalizing them into pop.
Following millenia sees a large increase in Ael'fae population in this area, and near-dissapearance of non-fae Ael.

## 4000 BC: Relations with the early Ael'Daal Empire

By the time the first large Ael'Daal civilization rose in southeast Eaos, the Daal'fae were quite well established across central Eaos.
They remained nomadic or semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers, but were quite prosperous. The more central tribes had little interaction with the Daal at this time, 
but the southern and western groups had regular dealings with them. 

Some 'fae were more open than others, but overal relations were cordial.

## 3000 BC: Ael'Daal decline, Lich Wars

Agricultural failures that marked the begining of the end for the early Ael'daal empire had little effect on the 'fae, but did drive the Ael ever-outward, often into lands where the 'fae had previously been the sole residents.
Cased increase tensions, but nothing major

Many southeast fae tribes enslaved or destroyed. Of these, Hyena tribes are the only ones who still survive in modern day.
Lion fae relatiosn with Ael soured. Never frendly, but at least cordial; now universally hostile.
Antelope tribes flee north and east. Some 'fae groups among them chose to embrace new lands more intimately, starting the goat tribes.
Some groups encounter the new Ael'jinn settlement.

Ael'daal refugees begin settling southern great river. Northeast fae still see little impact.
Some 'fae refugees take over a failed Ael settlement, starting the shapeshifter commune.

## 2300 BC: Ael'Daal expansion into central Eaos.

About 600 years later, Ael'daal civilization has found its footing again, and begins rapid expansion into central and northeas Eaos.

Early into this expansion, relatiosn between the two groups were cordial, but the more the Ael'daal razed the wilderness for farmland, the more relations degraded.
From the Ael'daal perspective, they're just clearing "useless" wilderness to make it into a productive food source. 
However, the Daal'fae had been cultivating and subsisting on the natural bounty of the wilds for a couple milenia at this point, and in their eyes, the Ael were destroying the work of past generations for no good reason.
In the wake of the Ael expansion, the 'fae generally continued to harvest the same land their ancestors did, even when this land now hosted Ael crops.
This served to only escalate tensions, which ultimately boiled over a few times in the following centuries, in the form of massacres of certain 'fae groups by the Ael. 
A number of survivors found their way to the shapeshifter commune.

The fae and the Ael eventually settled into an uneasy peace, with the Ael for the most part, retreting further into the wilderness, and the Ael mostly remaining in their established borders.

## 500 BC: The Uon War reaches Eaos

When the Uon war reached Eaos in 500 BC, many Ael'daal refugees from southwest Eaos fled to central Eaos, swelling the Ael population and further pushing the 'fae to what meagre wilderness remains.

## 50 AC: Modern Day 

In the mordern era, relations between the Ael'daal and 'fae remain strained. The 'fae still believe they should be able to pass freely through all Eaos, and take of its fruits as they need. 
Furthermore, the past violence inflicted on them by the Ael has left an enduring distrust, and little willingness to open dialogues.

Opinions of the 'fae among the Ael are a bit more divided. Many rural 'daal consider the 'fae to be nothing more than thieves. Many city-dwelling Ael have no opinions on the 'fae whatsoever.
The official policy of the current Elyos Republic government is that the Daal'fae are an independant nation whose borders overlap their own. 
The republic will nominally repay any 'daal farmer whose crops are taken by the 'fae, in the form of a tax credit. Actually claiming this credit is difficult, so this policy does little to improve the opinions of the rural daal.

Particularly predjudiced Ael sometimes capture and torture 'fae, leaving their bodies as a warning to others, though this is farly rare. 
More commonly, supersticious Ael will string up butchered carcasses of mundane deer, in the hope of keeping wandering 'fae off their land.
