## Dragon War

Around when the Ael' truly began to develop as a nation, the native dragons objected to the encroachment upon their territory.
After several skirmishes culminating in the complete destruction of a large Ael'daal settlement, a massive force of Ael banded together to hunt down and kill the dragon responsible.

This caused a great clamour across the dragon race, who until then had never had to fear anything except for other dragons. Some dragons wished to destroy the Ael in their entirety, 
while others councilled forging an aliance with them. This schism eventually grew into all-out war, with some dragons intent on wiping the Ael of the continent, others protecting Ael cities, 
a small handfull joing with the Ael armies, and some staying out of the conflict altogether.

While this conflict was centered on Eaos, it did involve the worldwide dragon population. The effects on the Ael civilizations outside of Eaos-Mhidda was less significant, but still notable.

- The Ael'thal formed an early truce with the dragons, giving up a significant amount of land in exchange for a more harmonious relationship. 
- The Ael'xhal sided with dragons wholesale, eventually causing the start of the Dragon Empire, spanning Xuon and the
- The Uon (who were considered to be just another race of Ael by the dragons) were decimated, and went into hiding in northern Xuon for a few hundred years.

Eventually, the dragon factions siding with the Ael were victorious, after many dragon casualties, and many more Ael casualties.

What would eventually become Ironfire citadel was founded during this war.

## Ruins of Ælmos - First Era Æl’daal civilization

Centered in what is now the great Eos desert. 
Ruins – mostly tombs or mausoloeams. Obelisks and large statues are common. Step pyramids rare but present. Tombs usually have undead guardians (zombies + a sleep/wake spell. Generally have ornate animal death masks. 
Some tombs house liches.

## Uon War
Primarily Uon vs. Æl’daal & ‘jinn. Æl’fae (apart from the Xhal'fae who had already been fighting the Uon for a couple millenia) avoided major conflicts, but some groups did participate in guerilla tactics against the Uon. 
A relatively small number of midh actually fought, but they did make many of the weapons for the ‘daal and ‘jinn. This may have led to the founding of the hollow cities?
