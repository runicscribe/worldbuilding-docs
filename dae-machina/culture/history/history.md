## Dragon War

Around when the Ael' truly began to develop as a nation, the native dragons objected to the encroachment upon their territory.
After several skirmishes culminating in the complete destruction of a large Ael'daal settlement, a massive force of Ael banded together to hunt down and kill the dragon responsible.

This caused a great clamour among all dragons, who until then had never had to fear anything except for other dragons. Some dragons wished to destroy the Ael in their entirety, 
while others councilled forging an aliance with them. This schism eventually grew into all-out war, with some dragons intent on wiping the Ael of the continent, others protecting Ael cities, 
a small handfull joing with the Ael armies, and some staying out of the conflict altogether.

While this conflict was centered on Eaos, it did involve the worldwide dragon population. The effects on the Ael civilizations outside of Eaos-Mhidda was less significant, but still notable.

- Many of the Ael'midh retreated underground to protect themselves from hostile dragons, forming the precursors to the Futhern Dal.
- The Ael'thal formed an early truce with the dragons, giving up a significant amount of land in exchange for a more harmonious relationship. 
- The Ael'xhal sided with dragons wholesale, eventually causing the start of the Dragon Empire, spanning Xuon and the eastern reaches of Kita Lau. The Ael'xhal in western Kita Lau were largely ignored, due to a variety of factors - 
  their relatively sparse population, the obscuring jungle terrain of the region, and the alliances formed by the Ael'thal and eastern 'xhal.
- The Uon (who were considered to be just another type of Ael by the dragons) were decimated, and went into hiding in northern Xuon for a few hundred years.

Eventually, the dragon factions siding with the Ael were victorious, after many dragon casualties, and many more Ael casualties.

What would eventually become Ironfire citadel was founded during this war.

## Lich Wars

After a thousand years of prosperity, things began to take a turn for the worse.

The constand farming had begun to take a substantial toll on the land, leading to scarcer resources.
This prompted harsher taxes and greater militarization in an attempt to conquer more fertile, poorly defended lands to the northwest.

Around this time, the elementalists seceded from the newly formed Empire and migrated east.

Meanwhile, in the Eaosian capitol, a group of mages researching animancy andnecromrancy pioneered the creation of zombie armies, to form a force of tireless warriors with no need for food. These armies greatly enhanced the efficiency of the empire's conquest.
About sixty years later, fourteen of these researches perfected their necromantic skills, and became the first true liches. 
As these individuals were arcane researchers with little combat knowledge and few ambitions outside the pursuit of knowledge, this had little immediate impact.

The reigning empire of Aelmos showerd immense wealth upon these new liches to convince them to make him immortal as well, but his reliance on the mages led to him becoming a puppet emporer.
Meanwhile, rampant famine and growing unrest led to scattered redbellions, and more remote regions split off to form their own nation-states. Many of these began their own necromrantic research, in the attempt to combat the zombie armies of the Empire.
At the same time, news spread of the immortal emperor and his council of liches, and various mages attempted to reproduce the feat.
One of the first of this second wave of liches was a master Golemancy (Hath). Others included a skilled war-mage, and an elementalist (Raethe), from the same group who split of to form the 'jinn.

Meanwhile, the polical situation of the empire continued to decline, and the lich council began to fragment. Several were destroyed in the fallout.
One (Aktu) remained with the revenant emperor, and attempted to retain control of the capitol. 
Two others remained nominally loyal, and mustered zombie armies to subdue the rebels and fragmenting nation-states. These two gained significant combat experience, and a new appreciation for their nearly invulnerable forms.
A fourth took his riches and retreated into seclusion.

At this point, the situation devolved into all-out war between fragmented lich-kingdoms.

Killing the various lich-kings proved to be difficult, even for other liches. The most succesful method of neutralizing a lich became magical imprisonment, coupled with overwhelming force of arms.
 - Drive the lich to the center of the territory
 - Keep them busy with minions
 - With the assistance of subservient mages, surround the region with a warding circle
 - Drain arcana from the circle, and enchant it with a continues drain effect to force the lich into dormancy.
 
At this point in the war, the armies of each kingdom were all entirely magical, so the effects of the warding circle prevented anyone from actually entering and permanently destroing the trapped lich.

After one lich (Keth) had defeated all the others, he tried to expand eastward, where he was promptly eliminated by the 'jinn, who had at this point become well established in New Aelmos.

With the central Eaosian empire a desolate, infertile wasteland, and all of the lich-kings imprisioned or destroyed, the remnants of the Eaosian civilization began to rebuild on the northwestern fronteir.


During this strife many civilian inhabitants fled northwest.

## Ruins of Ælmos - First Era Æl’daal civilization

Centered in what is now the great Eos desert. 
Ruins – mostly tombs or mausoloeams. Obelisks and large statues are common. Step pyramids rare but present. Tombs usually have undead guardians (zombies + a sleep/wake spell. Generally have ornate animal death masks. 
Some tombs house liches.

## Uon War
Primarily Uon vs. Æl’daal & ‘jinn. Æl’fae (apart from the Xhal'fae who had already been fighting the Uon for a couple millenia) avoided major conflicts, but some groups did participate in guerilla tactics against the Uon. 
A relatively small number of midh actually fought, but they did make many of the weapons for the ‘daal and ‘jinn. This may have led to the founding of the hollow cities?
