# Uon History

The Uon diverged from the same common ancestor Ældar about 100,000 years BC (Before Cataclysm). Early in their evolution, the Uon developed potent telepathic abilities that eventually defined their culture and appearance. 
Around 50,000 BC, the Uon had developed a collective consciousness spanning their entire species, and the Uon physiology had diverged substantialy from the Ældar.
At this time, they operated mainly as hunter-gatherers and inhabited the large island off the southeast coast of Xuon.

They developed agriculture quite quickly, as a collective conciousness makes it quite easy to remember what plants are nutritious (and expiriment with those that are unknown), how they grow, and where they grow well.
At this time, architecture was mainly of wood, clay, and brick. This early Uon nation gradually grew to cover all of their island.

Sometime around 7000 BC the Uon began expanding outward, and encountered the early Ael'xhal on the Xuon mainland. These two revelations - that there was land beyond their home island, and there were other people inhabiting it, 
caused a massive paradigm shift in the Uon Collective, and the Uon civilization began reorganizing into the something more closely resembling their ultimate form.

The initial expansion of the Uon into the mainland was very slow - since the Uon had been a unified collective for effectively their entire history, they had no weapons or combat strategy, 
outside of what was used for hunting animals. This expansion was abruplty halted by the Ael-Dragon wars of 5000 BC, during which the Uon were nearly eradicated.

The Uon slowly rebuilt their civilization over the course of the next 2000 years. Part of this rebuilding involved significant developments in magic and pseudo-industrialization.
By 3000 BC, the Uon had returned to and exceeded their former strength, and again set their sights on expansion.

They began establishing themselves on the southern Xuon islands and the south tip of the continent, eventually coming into conflict with the Ael'Xhal and the Xeres empire around 3000 BC.
This devolvled into a full-on war, with the Uon overpowering the Xeres empire, and eventually dominating the whole of the Xuon continent by 1900 BC.

During this campaign the Uon attempted to expand towards the Kita Lau archepelago, but were rebuffed by inhabitants of Dragonhalls.

Some time after this, the Uon began expanding towards Eaos. Conflict between the Uon and the Æl’daal continued over the next millenia, with the Uon gradually establishing territory on the western continent. 
All-out war between the Uon and Eoasian Ael only really began in 500 BC. By 100 BC, the Uon controlled much of the southwest coast of Eaos, up to but not including Trader's Bay.
  
The Uon civilization was completely wiped out when an attempt to create an artificial god/racial power source. 
This caused a magical overload across the Uon species, leading to their extinction, and threw the magical energies of the region into chaos, creating the riftscape.
This event marks the year 0 AC in the Eaosian calendar.
