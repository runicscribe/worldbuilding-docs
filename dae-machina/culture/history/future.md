100 AC

150 AC

## Specific Trends

### Empire of the Rising sun expansionism

Aware of fighting to east of Kita Lau, but no first person accounts
After cataclysm, became significantly more interested
Initial expedision to northern regions of shards of Xuon
General chaos and rise of Xeres reborn made progress slow, but eventually established presence on the northern edge of Xuon.

From here sent expeditions into the riftland
During this time, also made first landing on Eaos at uninhabited area of jungle covering the western eaos peninsula.

After imediate concerns from cataclysm were assuaged - namely that is was not an immediate existential threat, efforts split accross two paths

Monitoring and exploring the riftscape. Slow going, mostly magical researchers / mage corps

Exploring the newly discovered Eaos continent.
Started north of first landing, away from riftscape
Eventually encountered Ael'daal in a medium-sized coastal town.
Initial tense standoff, resulting in talks with Elyos govenrment.

Later expeditions:
 - further north, past ___ isles, running into conflict with Drakkar and Dhaigen Ilses
 - South, to traders bay
 - Incidental meeting between riftscape researches and riftlanders along NNE edge of riftsape.
 - Second northern expedition that landed on uninhabited wilderness on other side of Mhidda. Established an outpost, but ultimately too cold and inhospitible. Southern expansion to this side of Mhida mostly misterously disapeared, falling to Deep and Elder fae. 

<Skirmishes> - not all groups - mix of combat (Mhidda, northern Eaos) and diplomacy (Riftlanders, traders bay). Republic offically neutral, but ceased diplomatic contact until fighting in Mhidda ceased.
<Ceasfire, strained relations>

Improved relations

First meeting between Ael'daal and Ael'thal outside of Eaos-Mhidda occured at city of bridges, <Date>
First meeting on Quon Xi <2 years later>

 
### Tensions between Elyos Republic and Free Cities

After Elyos Republic got back on its feet after the Uon war, was rather discontent with the deals that led to the seperation of the Free cities in the immediate aftermath of the war, 
and wanted to get them back within the Republic.

Vindel, Grandel, Bridgeport all made significant money from the current arrangement, and stood to lose quite a bit of profit from unification.
Blackport, was also against unification given that most activities on the isle would be illegal under Elyos governance

The other cities had a more tempered opinion, or were in favor.

Events ultimately , coming to a head with an attack on Blackport by the Republic.
Rebuffed by shadowsteel company, rather firmer lines
Haven, Elgate and Eaosport for unification
Bridgeport, Blackport, Vindel against
Kenforod neutral - being a small city between Vindel and Grandel put it in a tenuous spot. Mages guild also had some rivalry/philosophical differentces with AoMMA
Grandel netral, leaning against (proximity to AoMMA made siding against unification too risky)

Developing situation with Empire of the rising sun caused Elyos to withdraw from military action.
Move mostly to negotionationg table, but moved very slowly due to more focus on EotRS situation.

Behind-the-scenes alliance between Republic + Haven to infiltrate Blackport council, bunch of coups and backstabbing on the isle.
Also slow going, because Blackport already very used to coups

Some form of reunification eventually occurs due to external pressured from the 'thal.

### Rediscovery of the Djinn

With 'jinn joining in at later stages of the Uon war, came start of relations between 'jinn principalities, Elyos republic, and Furthern Dal

Travel between republic and principalities still slow and dangerous, so this primarly focused around hollow cities, formed during the war.

In parallel, relations between 'jinn's rift expeditionary force and riftlanders.

'jinn efforts to remediate great desert _very_ slowly made travel easier.
Established 'jinn city at northern edge of desert that became second primary contact point.



### Quon Xi Space Program

Primarly magitech
Ran into many problems due to very uneven Arcana and Aether paterns outside of Daels influence.

Eventually successful landing on Aurum

Future attempts mostly abandoned magical propulsion methods, leaning on technological, but still used magitec for life support and similar, storing power in large crystals.
Pushed out to Argent (dangerous) and Alkyne.

Eventually established teleportation circle between Aurum and Dael, although only works during certain times. (Alkyne near, but not obscured by, Sunfire)

New  magical propolsion method
launching from north pole of dael during midyear convergence
Using angle to avoid obscurance, while still taking advantage of sunfire for power
Channel through Aurum and Alkyne to launch to outer planets.

First attempt successful, but unable to land anywhere:
 - Off-axus launch put them below orbital plane.
 - None of the outer planets were close enough anyways.
 
Unable to return - atempted through nonmagical propulsion, but futher out than anticipated.

Future attempts stymied for a while, focused on mining/colonization of Aurum.

Underlying space tech slowly converges on magically manufactured but otherwise mundane technologies.
