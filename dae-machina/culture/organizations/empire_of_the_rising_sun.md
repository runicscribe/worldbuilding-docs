# Empire of the Rising Sun

Æl’dhal empire on the western continent. Run by an emperor and an array of councilors and bureaucrats. Has a powerful and well-organized army, with an equally powerful military cadre of mages. 
Magic in the Empire is highly is highly institutionalized and regulated. Ceased communication with the eastern continent during the Uon war.

Capitol: 山城 – Shānchéng - “City atop the Mountain”. 

The southeast region is the hearland of the empire, extending well into the mountains.
The central-southern valleys have been part of the empire since the first dynasty, and at this point are culturally very similar.
The westmost island of Kita Lau has been part of the empire for a similar amount of time, although it is still quite culturally distinct, especially the east coast.
The northern reaches of the continent were only absorbed during the early part of the second dynasty, and there are still some tensions between this region and the heartland. 
The northenmost communities are still effectively independant.
The western plains are likewise a recent addition, and are treated more as a colony than as an integrated part of the Empire.


## The Eternal Emperor

The emperor's consciousness is actually held in a thick gold and jade necklace with a large emerald at its center.
Whoever wears this necklace is considered the emporer; when a new emporer is crowned, they are bestowed the necklace as a symbol of their position.
Initially, it acts as a repository of knowledge, and can provide guidance. As the years go by, the thoughts of the new emperor merge with the conciousness of the necklace, until they are indistinguishable.
In this manner, it can be said that the Empire has had the same ruler for the last 2100 years, even if the body sitting in the throne has been different.

The true nature of the emperor is known only to a select few. Most think the neclace is a badge of office and historical relic, and the title of is "Eternal" either a descriptor of the Empire itself, 
or a reference to the fact that the title of Emperor has been held by the same unbroken family line since the beginning of the 2nd dynasty.

Unlike most autocratic governments, rulership of the Empire passes onto the heir (typically the Emperor's firstborn son) upon their coming-of age, instead of the death of the current emperor.
This tradition started because the entity in the necklace much prefers a younger body, and has now been going on long enough that it is just seen as normal.
Often, the new Emperor retains some of the wives he had in his past incarnation.

When the mantle of emporer does pass over, the old Emporer's conciousness has typically entirely merged with the necklace, and if his old body is still alive it reverts to a semi-vegetative state, 
and is moved to a secret retreat where it is cared for, in part as a backup in case something unfortunate happens to the Emperor's new body.

## History

Near the beginning of the Dragon War, the Ael'thal formed an early truce with the dragons, giving up a significant amount of land in exchange for a more harmonious relationship.
Those in the western heartland retreated to the coast and mountain valleys, breaking into various independant tribes.

Over the following centuries, these tribes grew into small nations. After miscelaneous border wars, one of these succeeded in conquering the several of its neighbours, forming the beginning of the Empire of the Rising Sun. 

### First Dynasty

The First Dynasty of the Empire of the Rising Sun spanned roughly 4,500 BC to 2,000 BC. In the beginning, the empire included the east coast of Quon Xi and the west cost of the westernmost island of the Kita Lau archepelago.
The warlord who founded the empire was an effective conquerer, but not so good of a ruler. However, her son was, and this helped ensure the continuation of the burgeoning empire. 
After the early years of expansion, the growth of the empire slowed considerably, as its focus shifted to ensuring the continued security of its territory. 
Things continued much in this manner, ruled by the same family, for about 500 years until a new family seized control in a short but vicious civil war. 
However the empire persisted, and shifted into another expansionary period, in particular towards the inland mountain regions and deeper into Kita Lau. 

The history of the first Dynasty continuation much in this way for the next two millenia, with some periods of expansion, some periods of stability, and the occasional transfer of power to another ruling family, often through civil war.

### Second Dynasty

The second dynasty began around 2,000 BC, with another civil war, and the ascension of a new Emperor. This conflict was particularly extensive, and resulted in a somewhat fractured empire.
However, before looking to reunification, the new Emperor put in motion plans to secure his rule for all eternity.
After his ascension, he used the resources of the empire to fund research into necromrancy, and directed the forging of a powerful amulet, which would hold his conciousness after the death of his body.
This amulet became a part of the Emperor's formal vestements. When the Emperors son first put on the amulet upon his ascension to the throne, he initially just got access to the knowledge of his father, helping him to be a better ruller.
Gradually, the conciousness in the amulet overwrote his own, and the first Emperor of the second dynasty lived again. In this way, the second dynasty has had the same ruler for its entire duration.

Assured that his immortal rule was secure, the emperor began a reunification campain during the lifespan of his second body, and gradually brought the fragments of the First Dynasty back under the mantle of a single empire. 
This reunification marked the official start of the second dynasty. At this time, the emperor also added "The Eternal" to his list of titles.

There have been a handfull of assasination attempts across the history of the second dynasty, but even those that were successful in killing the emporers body ultimately failed, 
as one of the assasins would always pick up the amulet as proof or prize, and fall under the sway of the Eternal Emperor's conciousness.   

There have been a few instances where the emperor did not produce a son, only daughters. Usually, this resulted in the rulership passing to the Emperor's first grandson by his eldest daughter, but in at least one instance,
there were no male heirs when the current Emperor died, and the title instead passed to a female heir.

The Second Dynasty has been rather more stable then the first. While there have still been conflicts and internal strife, inevitably these are stamped out by the true Emperor. Expansion of the Empire has been much more steady, 
and in the present day it has grown to span most of Quon Xi, with only the northenmost and westernmost regions remaining independant.

The empire was largely isolated from the Uon war, and as a consequence is currently the largest and most stable country on Dael.
