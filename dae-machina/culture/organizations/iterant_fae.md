# Iterant Fae

The vast majority of fae were born in one of the traditional fae communities
 - Daal'fae caravans
 - Midh'fae clans
 - etc

A moderate number do wind up elsewhere, but nature of 'fae genetics and wide variety of 'fae types means that multigenerational 'fae families in predominantly non-fae communites are exceptionally rare.
Main exceptions are the Xencha Defiant and the Sachean Diarchy, which maintain a relatively even popilation split of 'fae and non-'fae.

Generally gravitate towards diverse cities that are already friendly to outsiders, but you will occasionally run into a lone 'fae in some random backwater town.
Cities with notable 'fae populations include:

 - Most of the Free Cities, especially Elgate, Haven, Eaosport and Arcmuth
 - Many Riftlander cities
 - Many Drakkar clans, especially the more northen ones
 - Druidic communities on the Draisblodh isles
 - Dragonhalls
 - The Queen's Valley druids in southeastern Quon Xi
 - Mountain monastaries between the southern valleys of Quon Xi

In such cities, minor 'fae physical characteristics will often show up without direct 'fae ancestry, having skipped a few generations.
