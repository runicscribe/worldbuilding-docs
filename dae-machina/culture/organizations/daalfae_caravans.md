# Daal'fae Caravans
Among the Daal'fae, there are a number of large nomadic caravans that follow fairly rigid paths across certaon sections of Eaos.

Size varies from extended family (30-50) to very large - some basically travelling towns, with thousands of members.
Largest caravans are southeast of great river. Northwest caravans used to be larger, but were displaced by redistribution of Elyos Republic during Uon war.

Maintain fairly rigid routes, following path that takes 3 - 9 months (108 - 324 days) to complete.
Includes established meeting points with other caravans to exchange news and goods. 
Due to different travel lengths, cadence of actual meetups is not always every round trip


Days travel consists of gathering food and other resources from the wilderness.
Elders mostly stay on carts (pulled exclusively by direbeasts or shifted members), performing light work like making or mending cloths or tools.
At night, wagons are arranged into semicircles to form a walled camp. 

While the caravans mostly gather resources from wild crops, over the years these have been intentionally cultivated and seeded to some degree, across many curcuits of the caravan.


Primarily consist of various Cervid tribes, as the Canine and Feline Daal'fae are less nomadic, primarily inhabbiting semi-permanent settlements throughout the great plains.

## Largest Caravans

### Great Plains Tribe
Largest active caravan. Quite traditionalist. Spends majority of time SE of Great river.
Follows an annual route, in an irregularly-shaped, clockwise circuit through the great plains southeast of the great river, ending each year by meeting with Center Inland and other tribes on the northwest side of the river. 
Every three years, this meeting includes Northern Foothills and Eastern Valley tribes.

While traveling, the caravan spreads out to cover a radius of around 30 - 50 km, both to optimize the amount of resources it can gather, and to limit the damage to the environment.

Mostly various types of antelope

### Crescent Route

This caravan route follows the edges of the Eaosport Sea: From the shapeshifter commune, to an occasional meeting with the center inland tribe, then through the coastel free cities, and ending at one of the northernmost Riftlander settlements.
Every 3-4 years, this includes a meeting with the Great Plains tribe shortly after leaving this settlement.
The journey takes 3 months from start to end, for a 6 month round trip.

One of the rougher caravan routes; includes travel through jungle, swampland, two river crossings, and touches upon the edge of the Riftscape. For this reason, the caravan has very few wagons - nearly everything is carried on
the backs of the caravan members, fae or direbeast. Shelter primarily consists of hide tents.
Elder caravaneers often retire in the Shapeshifter commune or among the center inland tribe.

Consists of a number of smaller sub-caravans that share most of the same route, but often briefly diverge.
Some of these follow the crescent route half the year, and run up and down the great river the other half, timing things to meet with the other caravans at the great gathering place.
Considered (overly) "progressive" by the other daal'fae - so much time through and around the free cities means many caravan members have picked up many customs and manerisms from the cities.
During the Uon war, thid caravan integrated fragments of other caravans that were destroyed or displaced, and was fairly seriosly impacted by the war itself.
In part due to this, it has an extremely diverse membership, including a variety deer fae, antelops, canids, and even felines (mostly xhal'fae)
Regularly escorts members of the shapeshifter commune and riftlanders travelling to the free cities.

### Center Inland Tribe
Caravan route follows a half-year cycle, travelling counterclockwise around inland Eaos, north-west of great river.
Every year and a half, meets with Northern Foothills tribe at site of great annual gathering (every other one of these also includes Great plains and Eastern Valley). 
Travels with Northern Foothills for about a month following this meeting.
When their schedules align also meets up with Crescent Route (Irregular cadence, avgeraging twice every three years)
Less traditionalist than the Great Plains Tribe, but otherwise quite similar.

The Center inlands tribe in particular has generally poor relations with the local Ael'daal, as the caravan route runs straight through the Elyos heartland, and each group considers the other to be stealing from their land.
The 'fae will harvest whatever crops they find without care for Elyos land boundaries. Meanwhile, the Elyos will often threaten violence if they find the 'fae on their land.
The more surly or superstitious farmers will string up butchered deer carcasses whenever a caravan is in the area, in the hope of warding the 'fae away.

Mostly Deer 'fae

### Northern Foothills Caravan
Clockwise circit following the foothils of the dragonspine mountain range, from Teythmos to Dragonspire to Arcmuth, then south along river, meeting up with Great Plains tribe (every 3 yrs) and Center Inland tribe (Every 1.5 years). 
Travels west back to Tethmoys accross northern plains. The full trip takes three-quarters of a year; every year and a half (i.e. every other trip), travels w Center inland for the first month of this journy

Bulk of polulation is Reindeer, plus some goat 'fae from Eastern Mountain tribe.
During the Teythmos to Arcmuth segment, the caravan hosts a moderate number of Aeldaal and Aelmidh travelling that route.
Occasionally hosts to small numbers of Wolf midh'fae travelling to the free cities or to the canid tribes in the great plains.

### Eastern Valley Circuit

Small circuit - 2 and 1/3 months taking a counterclockwise route around the plains east of the northerly Free Cities.
Once every three years, extends this circiut to join up with the great gathering west of the Great River, extending the length of the journey circuit by about a month.

Red Wolves + Wild Dog fae.
Largest fully nomadic group of carnivore daal'fae
Membership rotates frequently, at any given time about 1/3 of the caravan's membership is made up of young adults seeking a new home and/or a mate 
Sometimes also includes small groups of deer, antelope, or goat fae part that are part of smaller caravans or moving between caravans.

### Eastern Mountain Tribe

Clockwise circuit starting at Arcmuth, following the Dragonspine mountains, and returning through the northerly plains, returning to Arcmuth after three-fifths of a year.
Meets wiht Northern Foothils tribe near Arcmuth about every 12 years.
Meets with the Eastern Valley Tribe approximately every other year, except in years meeting the Northern Foothills tribe.

Consists mainly of Goat Fae, plus some various antelopes.
Similar to the Crescent Route, this caravan traverses a fairly rough route, mainly accross montainsides, and therefor includes few wagons, with everything being caried by the caravan members.
Shelters are mostly intricate folding contraptions made of wood and various textiles dyed in bright colors - cotton, wool, and others.

## Other Tribes

Smaller, less interconnected tribes.
- Handfull north of Teythmos, occasionally meet with NF - Sheep, Reindeer.
- A couple small caravans travelling different segments of the Great River. Get on well with Crescent route, but more traditional tribes feel like they are too closely alligned with Free Cities.
  Includes group maned wolves that actually sail the river, antelopes, others/
- A couple tribes along the coast south of Teythmos, which mostly interact with the Center Inland tribe - Mostly Deer-fae 
- One small, especially hardy tribe that makes the trip accross the desert between the eastern great plains (starting at the eastmost terminus of the Eastern Mountain tribe) and the westmost 'jinn cities (some form of antelope)
- A few other tribes near the boundary between the great plains and great desert. (Wide variety)
