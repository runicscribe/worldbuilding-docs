# Futhern Dal

The Futhern Dal are a collection of independant city-states found on mainland Mhidda, near the eastern reaches of the Dragonspine Mountains. They dwell in large mountain strongholds which extend deep underground. 
Their skill at stonework and artifice is legendary across Eaos-Mhidda.

A typical Futhern Dal city-state consists of a citadel built on the upper edges of a broad, fertile valley, with additional fortifications around the valley edge. 
Farms extend in and around the valley, out to about a half-day's travel (roughtly 12km) from these fortifications. 
The presence of Drakkar tribes throughout the coastal and heartland regions of Mhidda makes controlling land that is further away difficult. 

The citadel itself extends deep underground, with enough space to comfortably hold the entire population. The furthest reaches of the underground sections often incorporate extensive mines.


## Leadership and Politics
Most Futhern Dal strongholds are lead by a hereditary monarchy, often reaching back thousands of years to the original founders.
Neighboring citadels often form alliances, which are frequently cemented by marriage of the cities respective heirs. Despite this, it is very rare for one king to rule over multiple cities, at least for more than a couple of generations.
Even when a new stronghold is founded, it will usually be ruled by a second son or other relative of the lord of the founding city.
Ultimately, each city is both remote enough and defensible enough that the logistics of rulling multiple are challenging and there is little to prevent whatever leader is installed in any vassal city from just seizing control.
It is typically more fruitful to just have individual leaders rule over their own cities and maintain strong alliances with neighboring cities through blood ties.


Furthern Dal tend to be conservative and isolationist.
They are suspicious of outsiders, though moreso towards other 'midh than other foreigners. They are generally welcoming towards merchants, mercenaries and traveling entertainers.

## Magic and Artifice

The Furthern Dal are best known for their skills of artifice. They make some of the best enchanted weapons, armor, and tools in Eaos-Mhidda.
They are also responsible for the creation of several unique works of artifice, such as the cityseeds that are used to form some Futhern Dal citadels.

Less known but perhaps more impressive is that some Futhern Dal can transmute food out of other matter. This talent was pioneered by the Futhern Dal precursors during the Dragon War and helped them survive in their underground refuges.
It has been preserved and improved ever since, but is still an extremely difficult work of magic. It is easier to transmute other organics (e.g wood) to food than simpler materials, but even that is quite difficult.

## Notable Citadels

### Múrthelberg

One of the oldest Futhern Dal cities. It remains a thriving city to this day.

The first city-seed was created in Múrthelberg, using the core of the city as a template.
As a consequence, many other cities have been created in its image, though only two of these are still inhabited, and neither has measured up to the original.


### Försnið Citadel

Constructed in 2,800 BC, alongside the Steinbörn Cityseed. 
The family who originally founded Försnið Citadel has retained control of this cityseed throughout the millenia and has spread out to rule over many cities, though each lord still retains independance.
The city (and all those built in its image) has several statues of its first queen.

Many cities have since been created in its image.
