# Elyos Republic

The Elyos Republic is the largest nation on Eaos, and is populated mainly by Æl’daal.

It was founded from a coalition of countries, under the shadow of the Uon war. After the end of the war it reorganized somewhat, with the Free cities and some of the Futhern Dal splitting away from the republic,
and the remainder truly unifying as a single country, albeit one with a number of distinct provinces.

The republic is (ostensibly) democratic, and is jointly goverened from Teythmos by a parliament of elected representatives, and a grand council.
The grand council includes major guildleaders, clergy leaders, army generals and ministers of government departments. These individuals are not elected, and instead rise to their positions through merit.
The council manages the day-to-day operations of the republic. For the most part, individual guilds and ministires govern themselves. Inter-ministry projects and disputes are also managed and resolved by the Grand council.
Major decisions (including any new laws) and foreign policy are managed by the elected parliament. Constitutional ammendments amd certain other particularly important decisions require a referendum of the citizenry. 

The inland regions of the kingdom are primarily farmland. The kingdom has a very well developed system of roads, and advanced architecture and stonework.
The Northern provinces bordering on Futhern Dhal strongholds are primarily fortified castles and strongholds surrounded by farms. Conrayd and Tayla com from one of these castles, near (32 N, 43 E).


Maintains a strong army with a large mage cohort. Founded and runs the AoMMA.
Army – Core of spear/shield legion with substantial mage support. Also maintains a number of special opps squads: Usually 4-8 person squads with a mix of skills and at least one magic user. 
These squads include the elite guard, infiltration, and assassination squads. Most of the army is comprised of graduates of the Academy of Magical and Martial Arts. 
A special elite branch of this army is secretly funded and commanded by the Eldar council.

## Academy of Magical and Martial Arts

The [Academy of Magical and Martial Arts](./aomma) is a prestigious academy governed by the Elyos military.

It is one of the larges schools of magic on the western continent, and provides training in Magic, Combat, and Magic/Combat synergy. 
It is not solely militaristic, and has a very well developed academic/research branch.
Because it is run by the military, it is somewhat independant from the rest of Elyos. 


## Northern Provinces

Former Midh nations that have been takeon over by the republic.
Initially annexed to help serve as a buffer from midh raids. Remain the main line of defense against agaist such raids.
Mostly still run by local midh lords, but beholden to laws of the republic.

## Teythmos

The capitol of the Elyos Republic is Tethmos. It is built on the edge of coastal cliffside.
It is among the largest cities of the world, rivaled only by the Mountain of Dawn (capitol of the Empire of the Rising Sun), and New Babylon (Capitol of the 'jinn cities).
It is the cultural center of the kingdom, and is home to various artisans and philosophers. It is also the center of the sea trade in the northern parts of the Republic, in part due to a sophisticated series of water locks that allow larger shipts to a large river that would be otherise innaccessable due to the cliffs.

Also hosts the Eldar Council.

Previously Eaosport, but was moved during Uon war.
Ruins subsequently claimed and rebuilt by Free Cities
