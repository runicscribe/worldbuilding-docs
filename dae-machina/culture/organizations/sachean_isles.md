# Sach'ean Diarchy

The Sach'ean Diarcy spans a group of small islands far into the ocean south of the 'jinn peninsula.

The main chain of four islands is jointly ruled by Ael'daal and Merfae monarchies. There are a handfull of other inhabited islands in the vicinity that are culturally similar, but not really under the rule of the diarchy.
The name is a portmanteau of the names for the specific groups of Merfae (Sache) and the 'daal (Dalean) people inhabiting the islands. 

The Diarchy is fairly isolated from the rest of the world. They have occasional contact with the 'jinn and more westerly islanders (including the Enjat-Tektun), but that's about it.
In large part because of this isolation, it has avoided many of the cataclysmic events that have transpired on Eaos over the last several millenia, and has become a small but advanced civilization.

The islands are missing a few specific advancements dating after the first-era Daal, and lacking access to certain materials. 
One notable example is that they have few reliable sources of high-quality gemstones - while some can be found in the active volcanic regions of the isles, these are too dangerous to mine reliably. 
This greatly limits the production of enchanted items, especially more complex devices.
Gold, silver, and copper are neither particularly rare nor especially common.
The metallurgy of the isles is also behind much of Eaos in several aspects, especially with respect to weapons-grade steel and the like.
Occasional trade with the 'jinn helps fufill some of these lacks. 

The population is a fairly even mix of 'daal and merfae, with perhaps slightly more merfae.
The 'daal and merfae populations are tightly integrated. All the major cities of the Diarchy extend well into the sea, with dwellings above and below water.
With a tidal range of around 2m, most of these cities have a sea-level area that is mainly walkways, stairs, and open areas, with underwater buildings below, and abovewater buildings set atop pillars.
Rafts, boats, and larger floating platforms are common in the open areas, and are often anchored to these pillars.

Underwater and abovewater dwellings are often connected by floating lifts, lifts which pass through the middle region. Normally, these lifts rest on the ocean surface but can be raised via pulleys.
Often, they are enveloped by stonework screens which water can pass through freely, while still providing some privacy.
The larger of these lifts are quite elaborate, and serve as common-rooms, where merfae and 'daal residents can gather without either being out of their element.

## Languages

The only languages used in the Sach'ean diarchy are Sacheal and Sache-sign.
This is both a consequence of, and contributor to their isolation. A small handful of traders know Aelmon, Sache-Fae, and/or Daelean, for interacting with the 'jinn, other merfae, or the Enjat-Tektun, respectively

Sache-sign tends to be used _more_ often than the spoken language, since it works above, below, and through water, with spoken word mostly used to get peoples attention.
As a consequence, Sach'ean cities can be oddly quiet, dominated by the sound of the ocean, calls of seabirds, and non-language vocalizations like laughter.

## Raft-town

Large, mobile town consisting of a mass of watercraft anchored to each other.
Varies in size and location.

Primarly a homebase for deep-sea fishing.
Also serves as a diplomatic embassy when island-whale or other leviathan-cult Merfae visit the vicinity of the Sach'ean isles (since the regions near the isles are far too shallow).
