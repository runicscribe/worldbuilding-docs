# Academy of Magical and Martial Arts

The Academy of Magical and Martial Arts is a prestigious academy governed by the Elyos military.

It is one of the larges schools of magic on the western continent, and provides training in Magic, Combat, and Magic/Combat synergy. 
It is not solely militaristic, and has a very well developed academic/research branch.
Because it is run by the military, it is somewhat independant from the rest of Elyos. 
As part of this arrangemt, the Elyos military will pay the complete tuition of a student in return for 10(?) years of military service.

The Eldar Council also has a more subtle influence over the academy, and helped in its creation.

Located at (22 N, 32 E).


Main Spire - Center
Tower Wings - Two quarter cylindrical shells, terminating in towers
Student/Journeyman quarters.
Shapeshifter Wing - Inexperienced shapeshifters tend to be somewhat
influenced by animal instincts. This, coupled with the frequent nudity
and loss of nudity taboo that generally results from learning basic
shapeshifting means that this wing tends to be quite unrestrained -
shapeshifted or nude students are rather common in the hallways, and
sex between these students (in human or animal form) is rather common.
Lower levels include kitchens, servants quarters
Terminating towers include astronomy tower and ...

## Arcmuth

The city of Arcmuth is adjacent to the Academy, but it politically seperate from it - while the Acadamy is run directly by the Elyos military, Arcmuth is a civilian city.
Arcmuth is about half a day's travel from the Academy by foot. It serves as a gathering spot fort for people and endeavors that want to be near the AoM&MA, but want a bit less regulation.
The city hosts a number of con artists, a few more legitimate peddlers of magical artifacts, and other diversions.
