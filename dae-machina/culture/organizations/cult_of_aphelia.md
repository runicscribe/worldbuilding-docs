## Cult of Aphelia

The Cult of Aphelia is an Eaosian sex cult, most prominent in coastal and southern Elyos. Its members mostly consist of middle and upper-class Eaosians.
It is organized into small sects. Membership in a sect is secret, even from other members (the exception to this is sponsers know any initiates they have sponsered, and vice-versa).

Each sect has a very loose hierachy based on the order of joining.
Since membership is secret, individuals are refered to based on this order, e.g. "First sister", "Second brother".
Members may also be named based on the motif of their mask, and the First Sister is also refered to as the "Matriarch"

Once a month (week?), all the members of the sect gather at sunset at a secret headquarters for an orgy.
Members arrive one-by-one, in the order of joining, wearing only a mask, robe, and (optionally) sandals.
Robes and sandals are left near the entrance. After the meeting, members leave in reverse order.

Between meetings, members may go to the headquarters to perform maintenance and restock supplies.
Maintain ample stocks of lubricant, contraceptions charms, etc. 

Once a year, many sects gather for a multi-day orgy. Several such gatherings occur accros Eoas, so that most sects have one close enough to attend.
This gathering may also include non-members, and often includes a large 'fae presence.

Three months prior, matriarchs meet to plan the location.

## Initiation
In order to maintain the anonymnity of members and keep the location of the headquarters secret from non-members, sects have fairy strict membership requirments
Any member can sponser a new initiate during one of the regular gatherings. If all members can agree, the sponser brings the initiate to the next gathering.

Before the eve of initiation, the sponser and the new initiate agree on an initial meeting place, some distance from the headquarters.
The sponser arrives robed and masked. The initiate is instructed to strip naked (or to arrive naked), and then blindfolderd with a leather hood.
The sponser leads the initate through a somewhat circuitous path to sect headquarters.

The initiate is then bound, and, still blinfolded, must bring each other member of the coven to climax (in reverse order of seniority) before the sun rises in order to pass the initiation.

If they are successful, leader instructs new member on the next meeting time, leaves them a robe and mask, and then loosens their restraint and blindfold, instructing them to wait 5 minutes before removing it.
The new member is expected to find their own way home, and in doing so learn the path to the meeting place.

If they fail, their sponser leads them (still naked and blindfolded) away from the meeting place (but not back to their original meeting place), so as not to reveal its location to a non-member, then removes the blindfold. 
The failed initiate, naked and coated in fluids, must find their own way home as the sun rises on a new day. 

## Spliting groups

The requirements of the initiation process puts a fairly rigid upper limit on the number of members any sect can have.
When a sect grows to large to induct new members, it will split into two (or more) seperate sects. Typically, the matriarch remains at the existing headquarters, and the next most senior female member forms a new sect. 


Traditional practice requires female leader.

### Disciples of Aphos

The Disciples of Aphos are a somemwhat less restricvive branch of the cult which allows male leadership.
They originated as a male-only version of the cult, following Aphelia's male counterpart, Aphos.
At this time, they were held in equal esteem to the Cult of Aphelia, but strictly seperate.

Since then, they have splintered into various, more flexible sub-groups. Some sects still maintain an all-male membership, others are mixed, with a male leader, 
and some even have an all-female membership (another thing which is not traditionally permitted)

The Disciples of Aphos are generally welcome at the Cult's annuall gatherings.
