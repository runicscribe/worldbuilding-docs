# Xhal Nations
The nations of Xuon and Kita Lau are host to a variety of peoples and cultures.
They are inhabited primarly by the Ael'xhal and xhal'fae, as well as the xhao'fae, a small number of merfae, and a large number of dragons, many of which who have uniquly close relations to the local Ael. 

Prior to the rise of the Uon, much of the Xuon continent and eastern Kita Lau was joined together as the Xeres Empire.
After the war and the subsequent cataclysm, much of this region as shattered into small, fracticious tribes.

Western and central Kita Lau hosts a more diverse mix of larger states and countries as well as smaller tribes.

Several of the states in the westernmost reaches of Kita Lau are nominally protectorates of the Empire of the Rising Sun, although still retain substantial independance.

Span Kita Lau and Xuon.
Mostly seperate tribes. 

## Protectorates of the Empire of the Rising Sun

Capitol: 水の上 都市 - Mizunoue Toshi - “City over Water”(City of bridges).

Commonly considered easternmost city to lie under the influence Empire of the Rising Sun.

## Independant States

### [Dragonhalls](./dragonhalls)

Built into and through the sides of a mountain chain in one of the central Kita Lau islands
Founded during/after the dragon war, by a pair of dragons who mostly wanted to stay out of the whole thing, while still using the influence they had over their territory to protect the local humans.

Has maintained a sizeable population ever since. Remained independant during the time of the Xeres Empire, and maintained somewhat more equal relations between dragons and humans during that time.
Served as a haven for refugees from the empire during that time.
Has grown extensively throughout the millenia, and now extends across several hundered kilomiters of mountain range, and hosts over a dozen dragons - the largest population of dragons in a single place anywhere in the world.
The draconic inhabitants consist primarly of the two founders and their children's families. However, it has also collected a couple more eccentric dragons who prefer living among humans to the more traditional draconic lifestyle.
A few of these dragons will even deign to be ridden by humans on a regular basis, most often on hunting trips.

Founders died fighting the Uon in 1500 BC and 90 BC, respectively. Current leader is their second child.

Modern times - closest relations between dragons and humans anywhere

Surrounded by extensive farmland on all sides, both in the surrounding valleys and lowlands, and in terraces up the edges of the mountains.
Home to particular unique cuisine, which incorporates quite a lot of megafauna - wurms, levaithans, krakens, etc.


## Small Tribes and Other Groups

### Xhal Tribes

Many small unaffiliated Ael'xhal tribes throughout Kita Lau, especially on the central island and the smaller southern islands. 

### Xhao Tribes

Vertical settlements, built into trees or cliffsides.
Sometimes live with other Ael'Xhal, sometimes just with Xhao.
In either case, typically trade with local Xhal.

Poor relations with the Quon Xi empire.

### Coastal Merfae

Coastal Merfae often have close relations with nearby Ael'Xhal and Xhao'fae tribes.

### Xencha Defiant

The Xencha Defiant are a moderately sized group of loosely organized, semi-nomadic tribes of Ael'xhal and Xhal'fae, living in eastern Kita Lau, the Shards of Xuon, and western Eaos.
They are one of the very few communities in which Ael'xhal and Xhal'fae live together in harmony.

While they may make camp in the same location for a while, they do not build permanent settlements, and can pack up camp and be ready to travel at a moment's notice.
As a consequence, they keep few possesions, limited by what they can easily carry. This, coupled with the warm climate, also means Xencha generally don't bother with clothing.

Despite their isolation and relatively aesetic living conditions, retain a fairly high level of technology, at least to the degree that is feasible with no industrialization.
This is seen primarly in their knowledge and the preservation thereoff, and their ability to construct highly effective tools from their environment. 

All Xencha are expert survivalists, skilled in tracking, hunting, foraging, and sometimes fishing. Most also learn basic magic skills, especially scrying, concealment, and countermagic.
Indiviuduals also typically learn some specilized skill, which may include medicine, bowmastery (encompassing bowmaking, fletching, and archery), more advanced magic skills, and more.

Xencha medicine couples magical techniques with the varied resources of the jungle, and is among the most effective on Dael. Likewise, Xencha bows are among the best around.
They lack metalcraft, but make up with this with a equally effective materials sources from animal products and easier to work minerals like flint and obsidian. 
They will also sometimes scavenge metal tools from other civilizations, but never rely on them.

Xencha groups rarely have fewer than eight or more than two dozen members. There will rarely be more than a couple children in any one group, as more than this number are difficult to care for given the Xencha lifestyle.

#### History

The Xencha Defiant originated on Xuon sometime around 3000 BC as a rebellion against the Xeres Empire. For 300 years, small tribes lived in the deep in the southern Xuon jungle, 
within the bounds of the empire, but not subject to it, sowing the seeds of its fall and liberation of the xhal peoples. 
The early Xencha were organized mostly into small cells, with little knowledge of the others. Individual cells had their own permanent camps, but still moved frequenly, 
and subsisted on a mix of resources stolen from the Xeres and obtained from the wilderness.
The Feline Xhal'fae originated with the Xencha Defiant during this time period, and soon made up a significant proportion of their numbers.

After the fall of the empire, some groups kept to these ways, living within the jungle and subsisting on its bounty. 
Other groups formed new settlements, in the ruins of the Empire. Some Xhal'fae continued to live in the wilderness, but didn't keep up most of the other practices of the Xencha, becoming wilder and more primitive.

The Xencha who remained continued their practices through the Uon conquest, and for a time the Xencha Defiant were the only independant group of Ael'Xhal on Xuon.

The remenants of these groups still exist in the current day, living deep in the jungle and keeping many of the traditions of the original rebellion.
Many have moved to more hospitable regions in Kita Lau and Western Eaos in the wake of the cataclysm, but some remain in the riftscape, where their particular skills allow them to survive where others could not. 
Nowadays, they are most often referred to as the Xencha Remnant.


### Xeres Reborn

The continent of Xuon was the most affected by the Uon Cataclysm, with over three quarters of its land mass being torn appart and incorporated in to the Riftscape.
The survivors of this desctruction were mostly located on the intact northeastern portion of the continent.  They included a significant number of Uon slaves of various nationalities, and the remenants of the Ael'Xhal and Xhal'fae population of the island.
The 'fae adapted to the change fairly readily (in part by utilizing some of the non-'fae as a readily available food source), while the other Ael survivors banded together into small encampents. 

In the following years, weaker bands have gradually been absorbed by the stronger and better equiped ones. Now, 50 years after the cataclysm, the largest of these is known as The Xeres Reborn, 
co-opting the name of an ancient Ael'xhal civilization that existed before the Xhal came in conflict with the Uon. 
They are headquarted out of an ancient Xhal ruin, but also have settlements in a number of relatively intact Uon forts.

The harsh nature of this rebuilding, coupled with the fact their population is almost entirely Xhal who have been at war for their entire lives, and/or former slaves, has caused them to take on some especially brutal practices.
Their society consists mostly of warriors/hunters, elders, and slaves. They have also taken the ancestral Xhal practice of sacrificing animals to the dragons of the isles, and corrupted it into a human sacrifice ritual, offering
blood to some unknowable god in exchange for protection from the riftscape (this is entirely superstitious, and does not actual have a tangible effect) 

A number of Xeres Reborn settlements at the edges of their territory have made agreements with the local Xhal'fae to provide living human sacrifices as tribute every several days, in exchange for their members being safe from the Xhal'fae.
