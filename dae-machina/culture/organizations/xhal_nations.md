# Xhal Nations
The nations of Xuon and Kita Lau are host to a variety of peoples and cultures.
They are inhabited primarly by the Ael'xhal and xhal'fae, as well as the xhao'fae, a small number of merfae and woodborn, and a large number of dragons, many of which who have uniquly close relations to the local Ael. 

Prior to the rise of the Uon, much of the Xuon continent and eastern Kita Lau was joined together as the Xeres Empire.
After the war and the subsequent cataclysm, much of this region as shattered into small, fracticious tribes.

Western and central Kita Lau hosts a more diverse mix of larger states and countries as well as smaller tribes.

Several of the states in the westernmost reaches of Kita Lau are nominally protectorates of the Empire of the Rising Sun, although still retain substantial independance.

Span Kita Lau and Xuon.
Mostly seperate tribes. 

## Protectorates of the Empire of the Rising Sun

Capitol: 水の上 都市 - Mizunoue Toshi - “City over Water”(City of bridges).

Commonly considered easternmost city to lie under the influence Empire of the Rising Sun.

## Independant States

### Dragonhalls

Built into and through the sides of a mountain chain in one of the central Kita Lau islands
Founded during/after the dragon war, by a pair of dragons who mostly wanted to stay out of the whole thing, while still using the influence they had over their territory to protect the local humans.

Has maintained a sizeable population ever since. Remained independant during the time of the Xeres Empire, and maintained somewhat more equal relations between dragons and humans during that time.
Served as a haven for refugees from the empire during that time.
Has grown extensively throughout the millenia, and now extends across several hundered kilomiters of mountain range, and hosts over a dozen dragons - the largest population of dragons in a single place anywhere in the world.
The draconic inhabitants consist primarly of the two founders and their children's families. However, it has also collected a couple more eccentric dragons who prefer living among humans to the more traditional draconic lifestyle.
A few of these dragons will even deign to be ridden by humans on a regular basis, most often on hunting trips.

Founders died fighting the Uon in 1500 BC and 90 BC, respectively. Current leader is their second child.

Modern times - closest relations between dragons and humans anywhere

Surrounded by extensive farmland on all sides, both in the surrounding valleys and lowlands, and in terraces up the edges of the mountains.
Home to particular unique cuisine, which incorporates quite a lot of megafauna - wurms, levaithans, krakens, etc.


## Small Tribes and Other Groups

### Xhal Tribes

Many small unaffiliated Ael'xhal tribes throughout Kita Lau, especially on the central island and the smaller southern islands. 

### Xhao Tribes

Vertical settlements, built into trees or cliffsides.
Sometimes live with other Ael'Xhal, sometimes just with Xhao.
In either case, typically trade with local Xhal.

Poor relations with the Quon Xi empire.

### Coastal Merfae

Coastal Merfae often have close relations with nearby Ael'Xhal and Xhao'fae tribes.

### Deep-sea Merfae

The Deep-sea Merfae have some contact with coastal mer-fae, but not with any other Ael.

Some build elaborate underwater cities. Very few non-Merfae have ever seen these (while many water-'jinn also live underwater, they are on opposite sides of the world).

Other groups maintain a nomadic lifestyle. This is most common ammong the Followers of the Leviathan, but not limited to them.

The Followers of the Leviathan are semi-nomadic, following their patron as it moves through the ocean. However, they still often build structures on the carapace of their leviathan, 
so they may still retain more permanent forms of housing than would be expected from a nomadic people.

Many Merfae mages do learn shapeshifting abilities, but they most often tend towards chimeric shapeshifting, taking on characteristics of various deep-sea beasts.

Three distinct paths:
 - Children of the Sea - most conventional - take on various aspects like tentacles or chitin armor, but remain roughly mer-fae shaped and sized.
 - Remora - Physically merge with a leviathan or other great sea-beast. This merging is initially reversible, but eventually becomes permanent. Lifespan extends to match the leviathan. 
   Will typically retain the upper-half of their original mer-fae body attached to some appendage, though this becomes increasingly vestigial over time.
 - Devourers - Become a leviathan the hard way - starting out as a normal, Ael-sized shifter and continuously accumulating mass, eventually reaching Leviathan size. Tends to result in more unique forms.

Remora and Devourers are most common among Followers of the Leviathan, and often become god-kings of their own splinter tribes.

 
 
### Xencha Defiant

Moderately sized, loosely organized tribe of Ael'xhal and xhal'fae that originated as a rebellion against the Xeres Empire. For 300 years, small tribes lived in the deep in the southern Xuon jungle, 
within the bounds of the empire, but not subject to it, sowing the seeds of its fall and liberation of the xhal peoples. After the fall of the empire, some individuals kept to these ways, living within the jungle and subsisting on its bounty.
These practices persisted through the Uon conquest, and for a time the Xencha Defiant were the only intependant group of Ael'Xhal on Xuon.

The remenants of these groups still exist in the current day, living deep in the jungle and keeping many of the traditions of the original rebellion
although they have mostly moved to more hospitable regions in the wake of the cataclysm. Nowadays, they are most often referred to as the Xencha Remnant.
Despite their isolation and relatively aesetic living conditions, retain a fairly high level of tech, at least to the degree that is feasible with no industrialization.

One of the very few communities in which Ael'xhal and Xhal'fae live together in harmony.

### Xeres Reborn

The continent of Xuon was the most affected by the Uon Cataclysm, with over three quarters of its land mass being torn appart and incorporated in to the Riftscape.
The survivors of this desctruction were mostly located on the intact northeastern portion of the continent.  They included a significant number of Uon slaves of various nationalities, and the remenants of the Ael'Xhal and Xhal'fae population of the island.
The 'fae adapted to the change fairly readily (in part by utilizing some of the non-'fae as a readily available food source), while the other Ael survivors banded together into small encampents. 

In the following years, weaker bands have gradually been absorbed by the stronger and better equiped ones. Now, 50 years after the cataclysm, the largest of these is known as The Xeres Reborn, 
co-opting the name of an ancient Ael'xhal civilization that existed before the Xhal came in conflict with the Uon. 
They are headquarted out of an ancient Xhal ruin, but also have settlements in a number of relatively intact Uon forts.

The harsh nature of this rebuilding, coupled with the fact their population is almost entirely Xhal who have been at war for their entire lives, and/or former slaves, has caused them to take on some especially brutal practices.
Their society consists mostly of warriors/hunters, elders, and slaves. They have also taken the ancestral Xhal practice of sacrificing animals to the dragons of the isles, and corrupted it into a human sacrifice ritual, offering
blood to some unknowable god in exchange for protection from the riftscape (this is entirely superstitious, and does not actual have a tangible effect) 

A number of Xeres Reborn settlements at the edges of their territory have made agreements with the local Xhal'fae to provide living human sacrifices as tribute every several days, in exchange for their members being safe from the Xhal'fae.
