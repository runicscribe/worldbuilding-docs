# Drakkar

The Drakkar are Ael'midh raiders and warriors feared all accross Mhidda. Most are skilled seafarers.
They are organized into clans led by warlords or clan elders.

## Northern Drakkar

The Northern Drakkar clans live so far north that farming is effectively impossible, so they primarly subsist through raiding the Dhagian Isles, the Futhern Dal, or even other Drakkar clans.
All of these clans live near the coast, and are skilled seafarers. They also supplement their resources with hunting and fishing.
The Northern Drakkar also count a fair number of Midh'Fae among their numbers - mostly wolves, but occasionally bears or selkies.


## Southern Drakkar

The southern Drakkar clans are percieved to be the same sort of raiders as the northern Drakkar by the other people of Mhidda, but in reality they are more varied.
Many of them are still raiders, just like the Northern Drakkar, but there are also clans that are primarly farming and/or fishing communities. These groups still have many warriors, mostly for protection from other Drakkar clans, 
so few non-clan-members ever get close.

Some older comunities are extensively fortified. As you go further south, fortified farming communities become more common, until you eventually reach the Elyos Provinces

## Dhaigean Drakkar

The Dhaigean Isles host some Drakkar clans, who originiated from coastal drakkar sent as raiding parties from the mainland.
Most have taken up many of the practices of Dhaigean, to the point that it can sometimes be hard to differentiate certain Dhaigean Drakkar from the northern Dhaigean clans.

Many utilise similar rune-magic as the Dhaigean.
