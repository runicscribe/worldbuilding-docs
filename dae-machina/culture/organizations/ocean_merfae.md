# Ocean Merfae

There are number of open ocean merfae civilazations that are largely irrelevant to world politics, due to being at the bottom of the ocean and having no interest in the land.
These merfae may have some contact with coastal mer-fae, but not with any other Ael.

Some build elaborate underwater cities. Very few non-Merfae have ever seen these (while many water-'jinn also live underwater, they are mostly on opposite sides of the world).

Other groups maintain a nomadic lifestyle. This is most common ammong the Followers of the Leviathan, but not limited to them.

The Followers of the Leviathan are semi-nomadic, following their patron as it moves through the ocean. However, they still often build structures on the carapace of their leviathan, 
so they may still retain more permanent forms of housing than would be expected from a nomadic people.

Many Merfae mages do learn shapeshifting abilities, but they most often tend towards chimeric shapeshifting, taking on characteristics of various deep-sea beasts.

This tends to go down one of three distinct paths:
 - Children of the Sea - most conventional - take on various aspects like tentacles or chitin armor, but remain roughly mer-fae shaped and sized.
 - Remora - Physically merge with a leviathan or other great sea-beast. This merging is initially reversible, but eventually becomes permanent. Lifespan extends to match the leviathan. 
   Will typically retain the upper-half of their original mer-fae body attached to some appendage, though this becomes increasingly vestigial over time.
 - Devourers - Become a leviathan the hard way - starting out as a normal, Ael-sized shifter and continuously accumulating mass, eventually reaching Leviathan size. Tends to result in more unique forms.

Remora and Devourers are most common among Followers of the Leviathan, and often become god-kings of their own splinter tribes.


## *Unnamed Leviathan-city*

Built into the shell of a collosal triclaw leviathan, who the leader merged with about two-thousand years ago.

## Chasmlight

Chasmlight is a massive, ancient abyssal merfae kingdom in the center-north of the Great Southern Ocean.
From above (still deep underwater), it almost looks like a night sky at the bottom of the ocean.

The city gathers a significant portion of its resources from things that fall from the ocean above.

The nation claims a huge area of the surrounding ocean floor as its territory, and only accepts Abyssal merfae. The city is generally hostile to nomadic merfae, abyssal or not.
Despite this, it has been involved in relatively few conflicts, as not many people care about this region outside of the city's inhabitants. As a consequence, it is actually one of the largest nations on Dael.

The 'jinn and and the Dragons are the only non-merfae who know this nation exists.

### Creches

Unlike many Lauan and Abyssal merfae communities, Chasmlight takes an active role in raising its young, meaning that basically all hatchlings survive to adulthood.
One abyssal merfae can lay thousands of eggs in a single spawning, so as a consequence reproductive rights are strictly regulated in the kingdom.

Eggs are collected at royal creches, typically located at the tops of tall towers, where the depth and pressure is lesser. Hatchlings are raised communally.

Due to this structure, the merfae of Chasmlight don't have the same sorts familial bonds that are found in other Ael communities. Instead, they create their own found families.

## Gyre Straights

Northeast edge of the rift.
Used to span most of the western sea, before the cataclysm. Now smaller and more northerly.
They use lots of materials scavenged from 4 millenia of shipwrecks, which makes there cities atypical when compared to other merfae settlements.
Mixed Sache and Abyssal 'fae.

Will occasionally sink more ships, for resources.
