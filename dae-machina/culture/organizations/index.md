## Independant States

### [Free Cities](./free_cities)

The *Free Cities* (also called "The Eight" or "The Eight Lordships") are a series of loosly affiliated city-states along the Great Eaos River.
This river is readily traversible and forms the backbone of trade across central Eaos.

The Free Cities are politically seperate from the Elyos Republic, althrough relations are generally cordial between the two. Given their influence on trade, 
any conflict with the Free Cities would have the potential to economically cripple the republic.

### Hollow Cities

Jointly founded by 'jinn, 'midh, 'daal, sometime after the 'jinn reconnected with the Eosian Aeldar in the aftermath of the lich wars.
Built underground, under the dragonspine mountains. Originally a single city, but has since expanded to multiple.

Primary exports are gems and metals. Import a significant proportion of their food from the Elyos Republic.


### Shapeshifter Commune

### Riftlander Cities

### [Necromancer's County](./necrocounty)

This small township is populated almost entirely by undead, who have all been animated by three journeyman necromancers.
The county itself was wiped out by a plague many years ago, with the necromancers coming later to take advantage of the supply of bodies, as a source of easy labor.
