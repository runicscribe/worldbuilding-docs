# Organizations

## Nations
Nations with a unified government spanning many cities.

### Empire of the Rising Sun

Æl’dhal empire on the western continent. Run by an emperor and an array of councilors and bureaucrats. Has a powerful and well-organized army, with an equally powerful military cadre of mages. 
Magic in the Empire is highly is highly institutionalized and regulated. Ceased communication with the eastern continent during the Uon war.

Capitol: 山城 – Shānchéng - “City atop the Mountain”. 

The southeast region is the hearland of the empire, extending well into the mountains.
The central-southern valleys have been part of the empire since the first dynasty, and at this point are culturally very similar.
The westmost island of Kita Lau has been part of the empire for a similar amount of time, although it is still quite culturally distinct, especially the east coast.
The northern reaches of the continent were only absorbed during the early part of the second dynasty, and there are still some tensions between this region and the heartland. 
The northenmost communities are still effectively independant.
The western plains are likewise a recent addition, and are treated more as a colony than as an integrated part of the Empire.

### [Xhal Nations](./xhal_nations)
(Æl’xhal and xhal’fae)
Made of mostly separate tribes, lead by a clan chief. Larger settlements (such as the city of bridges) are led by a chief and a clan council.
The western reaches of Kita Lao are have been colonized by the Empire of the Rising sun, and are more uniform.

#### City of Bridges
Also known as 水の上 都市 - Mizunoue Toshi - “City over Water”
Semi-independant city state marking the eastern edge of the Empire's control.

#### [Dragonhalls](./dragonhalls)

Built into and through the sides of a mountain chain in one of the central Kita Lau islands
Founded during/after the dragon war, by a pair of dragons who mostly wanted to stay out of the whole thing, while still using the influence they had over their territory to protect the local humans.

Both founders died fighting the Uon - one in 1,600 BC, driving off their incursion into Kita Lau, and the the other in 90 BC, fighting alongside the 'daal.
As a consequence, Dragonhalls and most of western Kita Lau has emerged largely unscathed from Uon expansionism.

### [Elyos Republic](./elyos_republic)

#### [Academy of Magical and Martial Arts](./aomma)

The Academy of Magical and Martial Arts is a prestigious academy governed by the Elyos military. It was constructed during the Uon-'daal war.

### ['Jinn Principalities](./jinn_cities)

Ael'jinn population is primarly found in a small number of very large cities.
Hereditary rule by founding High-jinn and their descendants.


## Independant States

Smaller states whose main level of government is at the city/settlement level.

### Dhaigean Isles (Runesea Isles)
Ael'midh tribes led by clan chiefs and/or shamans.

### Futhern Dhal (Mountain Strongholds)
Ael'midh strongholds/city-states that are lead by a hereditary monarchy.

### Drakkar Clans
Coastal Ael'midh clans led by warlords or clan elders

### [Daal'fae Caravans](./daalfae_caravans)
Among the Daal'fae, there are a number of large nomadic caravans that follow fairly rigid paths across certaon sections of Eaos.

### [Free Cities](./free_cities)

The *Free Cities* (also called "The Eight" or "The Eight Lordships") are a series of loosly affiliated city-states along the Great Eaos River.
This river is readily traversible and forms the backbone of trade across central Eaos.

Methods of government vary between cities, although most are ruled by one person, generally a Lord or Guildmaster. 
A council of Leaders from each city meets monthly to settle disputes and govern trade (and other interactions) between cities. There is frequent espionage and minor conflicts between cities (“squabbling”). 
Varying amounts of corruption, smuggling and counter-espionage among the cities. The free cities are home to a wide and varied mix of peoples. 

The Free Cities are politically seperate from the Elyos Republic, althrough relations are generally cordial between the two. Given their influence on trade, 
any conflict with the Free Cities would have the potential to economically cripple the republic.


### Hollow Cities

Jointly founded by 'jinn, 'midh, 'daal, sometime after the 'jinn reconnected with the Eosian Aeldar in the aftermath of the lich wars.
Lead by council of representatives of constituent Ael lineages.

Built underground, under the dragonspine mountains. Originally a single city, but has since expanded to multiple. Connected to the Elyos Republic and to the 'jinn cities by seperate teleporter networks.

Primary exports are gems, metals, and magically shaped tools and art. Import a significant proportion of their food from the Elyos Republic.


### [Shapeshifter Commune](./shapeshifter_commune)

Built on ruins of an old Aeldar city (Elysium), fairly deep into a swampy jungle.
Founded by a couple groups of Daal'fae, as a sanctuary for the fae.
Often used as a rest stop by nomadic Daal'fae tribes.
Over the years, the settlement has collected an eclectic assortment of fae inhabitants who felt they didn't fit in with their original family, but also didn't feel comfortable in the non-fae Ael cities 
- a mix of midh, daal, and xhaal fae, a variety of half'fae, the occasional half-'jinn, and a handfull Ester's lineage 'jinn, as well as a significant number of varied direbeasts.

The commune also grew substantially during the Uon war, as it took in a large number of Xhal'fae displaced by the conflict. Total pop is still less than 10k, and fairly spread out.


While the commune does not actually forbid regular Ael, it is not especially hospitable to them, so only a few especially ecentric individuals live there full time. 
In addition to these, there are a a moderate number of traders who pass through fairly often, drawn by both the various rare and valuable plants found in the jungle, and the other goods brought by the nomadic daal caravans.

Very different set of rules and assumptions from a normal Ael city, or even a 'fae clan.
Adopted the 'daal practice of identifying armbands, although have developed their own system on top of this that also incorporates jewelry in different colors to indicate things such as sexual interest, etc. 
No laws (or even cultural taboos) around nudity. 
Public sex is permitted (even encouraged), but generally considered as an open invitation to join in.

A ban on grievous violence and murder are the only truly hard laws in the commune. A small council is elected to enforce these laws, selected by nomination and confirmed through ritual combat.

Culturally, the commune demonstrates an odd mix of collectivism and individuality
Resources like food and water are considered to belong to the community as a whole. Meals are usually taken comunnaly. Monogamy is frowned upon.
Homes and other posessions are considered generally sacrosanct.


Structured as a large central gathering place, with dwellings scattered across the outskirts.
The central gathering is perpetually active, as a significant number of inhabitants are nocturnal or crepuscular.
In addition to communal meals, this area hosts are magic lessons, book clubs, markets (mainly barter), and more.

The surrounding land, being mainly jungle and swamp, is not well-suited to farming. As such, the diet of the settlement is heavily seafood focused. In part do to the number of inhabitints, 
it is one of the few communities to actively hunt many of the larger ocean denzeins. This meat-based diet is supplemented by produce from visiting daal'fae caravans.


### Riftlander Cities

The Riftlanders are a loosely organized group of explorers and adventurers who search the Riftscape for magical artifacts. The Riftlanders have established a number of towns and cities along the northeastern edge of the 
Riftscape, often among Uon ruins. In addition to adventurers, these towns also host:
    • Merchants that buy artifacts, and sell just about everything, taking advantage of the large numbers of adventurers, prospectors, and fortune seekers in the area.
    • Mages who study the riftscape and artifacts from the riftscape. Often try to get a good deal on artifact directly from adventurers
    • Archeologists, who are interested in the various ruins found in the riftscape.
    • Hunters/Rangers who hunt the outskirts of the riftscape for food and sometimes discover lesser artifacts.
Riftlander towns have many temporary residents, but also house some settled adventurers and families. A militia comprised of whatever adventurers and mages that are not currently exploring the riftscape handles defense 
from outside threats. Due to the transitory nature of the population, towns tend to contain quite a few taverns and boarding houses.
Riftlanders come from a mixture of backgrounds and cultures, including previous eldar slaves (Æl’daal, Æl’dhal, Æl’xhal and Xhal’fae), Æl’daal colonists and adventures, and various adventures mostly hailing from the free cities.
Riftlander architecture is primarly wood, with an Asian/Southeast Asian style, and often integrated Æl’uon ruins.

Because the weather of the Riftscape tends towards warm with frequent monsoons, riftlander clothing tends to be fairly light, and made of materials that are either water resistant or dry easily. 
Due to the blasted landscape, materials are scarce. Leather and hide are commonly used, cotton is reasonably common, and the more prosperous residents use silk. 
Adventurers usually prefer a durable outfit that is predominantly leather. Merchants usually wear some combination of a shirt, lose trousers, kimono, sari, sarong, usually in silk or cotton. 

There is a substantial cultural gap between the first generation of Riftlanders, who lived through the Uon Cataclysm, and the younger generations, who did not.

#### Underhill Crater

Capitol of the Riftlanders, insomuch as they have one - at any rate, the largest and wealthiest of the Riftlander cities.
Old Uon Citadel, in the center of a large, floating piece of stone.

### Dragon's Teeth Selkies

An isolated selkie population living on the Dragon's Teeth. 
The isles themselves are mostly barren, so the selkies subsist almost entirely on seabirds and other sealife.
This results in a very different culture than the mainland selkies.

#### White Scale Selkies

The White Scale Selkies are the largest community of Selkies on the Dragon's Teeth. 
The hunt island-whales, along with more typical prey. This results in rather different hunting practices and technology than other selkie communities, with more involvment from human-form selkies in boats. 
They have a unique relation with a dragon inhabiting the islands; after killing and processing an island-whale, they will set up a signal fire on it's carcass, atracting the dragon, who will gorge itself on the remainder.
Meanwhile, a seperate group sneaks into the dragon's lair to scavenge treasure. The dragon is fully aware this is happening, and deliberately set up a decoy room with less valuable things for the selkies to scavange, 
considering this fair trade for not having to do any work hunting (Although any selkies who get a little too greedy are still at risk of lethal reprisal).

### Sach'ean Diarchy

South of 'jinn peninsula.
The main chain of four islands is jointly ruled by Ael'daal and Merfae monarchies. There are a handfull of other inhabited islands in the vicinity that are culturally similar, but not really under the rule of the diarchy.
Name is a portmanteau of the names for the specific groups of Merfae (Sache) and the 'daal (Dalean) people inhabiting the islands. 

Fairly isolated. Occasional contact with 'jinn and more westerly islanders, but that's about it.
Mix of 'daal and merfae population. Cities are tightly integrated, extending below-water.
Small but advanced civilization, though missing a few advancements post first-era Daal, and lacking access to certain materials. One notable example is few reliable sources of high-quality gemstones - 
while some can be found in the active volcanic regions of the isles, these are too dangerous to mine reliably. This greatly limits the production of enchanted items.

### Enjat-Tehktun Alliance

Formerlly the Tehktun Islands Collective
Closer to riftscape.
Only some of the islands here are inhabited.
Mix of 'daal and 'xhal, and a very small number of Xhal'fae and merfae
Bit more communitcation with mainland, mostly Riftlanders (and previously, inhabitants of the now-destroyed group of large islands near the coast). 
Largely unscathed by the Uon-Daal war, but took quite a bit of damage (and many refugees) during the Uon Cataclysm.


### Mage Settlements
There exist various secluded settlements that are populated by like-minded mages that want to be free to practice their magic without interference from “civilized” society. 
This is most common with less socially accepted magic (such as necromancy), or magic that produces significant physical and psychological changes (animal shapeshifting).  
Less common are settlements of elemental sorcerers and powerful savants, who tend to use powerful, dangerous, and unpredictable magic 
(some such individuals instead seek out the Ael'jinn, who are more capable of handling their abilities). 
Many other mages also live reclusively (perhaps with an apprentice), especially those involved in esoteric magical research, particularly research that involves experimentation on creatures, elementals, undead or humans.


#### Eaosian Mage Settlements

Most Eoasian Mage Settlements have at least some connection to the AoMMA, and are typically between 200km and 1500km from the academy - close enough that it is still reasonable to get rare supplies from Arcmuth or Kenford, 
but not so close that the Academy interferes with their business.

##### [Necromancer's County](./necrocounty)

This small township is populated almost entirely by undead, who have all been animated by three journeyman necromancers.

The county that they took over was previously wiped out by a plague. These (relatively benign) necromancers reanimated the inhabitants (mostly farmers, plus some guards). 
Partly an experiment on the part of the necromancers in reanimating skilled labor, and in “automated” or “free” farming. For a group of necromancers, the members of this organization, 
are rather moral and refrain from murder, theft, and most other illegal activities (exceptions are gravrobbing and certain methods relating to obtaining forbidden, secret, or taboo knowledge related to necromancy). 
In addition to the three founders, the county has various accolytes, mostly necromancers (usually closer to the moral side of the alignment scale), and a few agricultural mages and non-mage researchers.

Many of the mages involved in this settlement spent some time at the AoM&MA, and several also spent time in the Free Cities.

##### The Radical Form Society

Collection of mages with at least some shapeshifting talent, who consider common expectations of appearance limiting. Many have only very basic cosmetic shapeshifting talents, so most residents have a humanoid shape, 
even if they have an otherwise unconventional appearance.
Large number of 'fae and 'jinn, including quite a few of Ester's lineage.
Second-largest 'jinn community west of the principalities, after the Hollow Cities.
Possibly the most visually diverse group in all Dael.

Hosts a medium-sized multidisciplinary mage school, 

Construct farm, trade with daal'fae caravans.


##### Cult of the Fleshhaper

Led by a powerful Chimeric shapeshifter
Shifting to overcome human limitations
Dose of the grotesque to isolate members from the wider world and force them to live within the cult.
Most accessible source of high-level biomagic in Eaos


## Other Organizations

### Eldar Council

The eldar council is an organization of very powerful beings primarly concerned with preventing magical disasters or cataclysms (such as the riftscape/Uon cataclysm).
The eldar council meets irregularily, usually only when one member deems it necessary. It is rare that all members of the council attend any one meeting, although there are many members who attend every meting. 
The council most often meets in the top floor of the Mediterranean capitol council chambers. The council has frequent dealings with the Order of Sion, and commands an ellite company of the Mediterranean army, 
recruited primarily from the Academy of Magical and Martial Arts. Members of the Eldar council qualify as anyone who knows about the council and has an open invitation to attend council meetings. 
Most ancient Ael’dar are members. Varios councile members are in positions of power among the nations of the world.

**Known Members**

Æl’syi lich (Regular)
Queen of Ravens (Regular)

Spectral Librarian
Sage of Life

### Order of Sion

The Order of Sion is a clandestine organization of users of mental magic, scattered across Eoas and Middha.

The order as it exists today was borne out of the Uon-Eos war. The conflict with the Uon caused ever-increasing increasing distrust of all users of mental magic, 
driving the more notable practicioners and their networks of like-minded mages underground. At the same time, the Eaos government saw the need to take advantage of such magic-users, as a contingency against the Uon.
The combination of these pressures led to the formation of the order,  which would protect at-risk practitioners of mental magic, preserve their techniques, and support Elyos against the Uon.
During the war, the order helped collect military intelligence and dampen Uon magic duiring assaults on Eaosian cities.

In the aftermath of the war, the average Eaosian had not become any more accepting of mind magic, so the Order remained underground. Baring an external threat, and preocupied by rebuilding everything destroyed during the 
conflict, the Elyos Republic largely lost track of the Order, which became ever more self-interested, shifting their focus to political influence and espionage. 
The Order now maintains agents in most major governments, subtly working to protect the Order and expand its power.
In order to augment their resources, the order also pivoted slightly towards mercenary work - if you know the right person to contact, you may be able hire their unique talents for a considerable fee.
This work mostly political machinations instigated by wealthy lords, but also encompasses the manufacture of scandals, general espionage, and influencing mariages among the high and mighty.

As the most advanced practitioners of mental magic in Eaos, some members of the Order of Sion have abilites that are otherwise unheard of across the continent. This includes the ability to swap minds between bodies,
limited mind control, implantation of false memories, novel forms of illusion, and more. Outside of the Order of Sion, mental magic across Eos is mostly limited to basic (consenual) telepathy, truthsaying, and mental protection.

Note: As they were not touched by the Uon war, the continent of Quon Xi does not have the same reservations against mental magic, and uses it as casually as any other magic. 


### Lesser Mage Schools

Does anyone seek out and train lone/orphan mages?

#### Kenford Mages Guild

See Free Cities: Kenford

#### Il’vos?
Initially founded during the Ældar civilization. Dedicated to maintaining peace and order. Members are generally skilled in encantation and clairvoyance. The Il’vos were responsible for creating the first stable darkstones. 
The Il’vos were mostly wiped out in a war with the Uon 1000 years before the cataclysm. However, the remnants of the Il’vos have begun to rebuild their organization.

## [Former Nations](./former_nations)

As history has wound its ways, many nations have rose and fell. Most have left their mark on Dael in one way or another.
