### Empire of the Rising Sun



### Elyos Republic

#### [Academy of Magical and Martial Arts](./aomma)

The Academy of Magical and Martial Arts is a prestigious academy governed by the Elyos military. It was constructed during the Uon-'daal war.


## Independant States

### [Free Cities](./free_cities)

The *Free Cities* (also called "The Eight" or "The Eight Lordships") are a series of loosly affiliated city-states along the Great Eaos River.
This river is readily traversible and forms the backbone of trade across central Eaos.

The Free Cities are politically seperate from the Elyos Republic, althrough relations are generally cordial between the two. Given their influence on trade, 
any conflict with the Free Cities would have the potential to economically cripple the republic.

### Hollow Cities

Jointly founded by 'jinn, 'midh, 'daal, sometime after the 'jinn reconnected with the Eosian Aeldar in the aftermath of the lich wars.
Built underground, under the dragonspine mountains. Originally a single city, but has since expanded to multiple. Connected to the Elyos Republic and to the 'jinn cities by seperate teleporter networks.

Primary exports are gems, metals, and magically shaped tools and art. Import a significant proportion of their food from the Elyos Republic.


### Shapeshifter Commune

Built on ruins of an old Aeldar city, fairly deep into a swampy jungle.
Founded by a couple groups of Daal'fae, as a sanctuary for the fae.
Often used as a rest stop by nomadic Daal'fae tribes.
Over the years, the settlement has collected an eclectic assortment of fae inhabitants who felt they didn't fit in with their original family, but also didn't feel comfortable in the non-fae Ael cities 
- a mix of midh, daal, and xhaal fae, a variety of half'fae, the occasional half-'jinn, and a handfull Ester's lineage 'jinn, as well as a significant number of varied direbeasts.

The commune also grew substantially during the Uon war, as it took in a large number of Xhal'fae displaced by the conflict. Total pop is still less than 10k, and fairly spread out.

While the commune does not actually forbid regular Ael, it is not especially hospitable to them, so only a few especially ecentric individuals live there full time. 
In addition to these, there are a a moderate number of traders who pass through fairly often, drawn by both the various rare and valuable plants found in the jungle, and the other goods brought by the nomadic daal caravans.

Very different set of rules and assumptions from a normal Ael city, or even a 'fae clan.
Adopted the 'daal practice of identifying armbands.
No laws (or even cultural taboos) around nudity. 
Puglic sex is permitted (even encouraged), but generally considered as an open invitation to join in.

A ban on grievous violence and murder are the only truly hard laws in the commune. A small council is elected to enforce these laws, selected by nomination and confirmed through ritual combat.

Culturally, the commune demonstrates an odd mix of collectivism and individuality
Resources like food and water are considered to belong to the community as a whole. Meals are usually taken comunnaly. Monogamy is frowned upon.
Homes and other posessions are considered generally sacrosanct.


Structured as a large central gathering place, with dwellings scattered across the outskirts.
The central gathering is perpetually active, as a significant number of inhabitants are nocturnal or crepuscular.
In addition to communal meals, this area hosts are magic lessons, book clubs, markets (mainly barter), and more.
### Riftlander Cities

### Xeres Reborn

The continent of Xuon was the most affected by the Uon Cataclysm, with over three quarters of its land mass being torn appart and incorporated in to the Riftscape.
The survivors of this desctruction were mostly located on the intact northeastern portion of the continent.  They included a significant number of Uon slaves of various nationalities, and the remenants of the Ael'Xhal and Xhal'fae population of the island.
The 'fae adapted to the change fairly readily (in part by utilizing some of the non-'fae as a readily available food source), while the other Ael survivors banded together into small encampents. 

In the following years, weaker bands have gradually been absorbed by the stronger and better equiped ones. Now, 50 years after the cataclysm, the largest of these is known as The Xeres Reborn, 
co-opting the name of an ancient Ael'xhal civilization that existed before the Xhal came in conflict with the Uon. 
They are headquarted out of an ancient Xhal ruin, but also have settlements in a number of relatively intact Uon forts.

The harsh nature of this rebuilding, coupled with the fact their population is almost entirely Xhal who have been at war for their entire lives, and/or former slaves, has caused them to take on some especially brutal practices.
Their society consists mostly of warriors/hunters, elders, and slaves. They have also taken the ancestral Xhal practice of sacrificing animals to the dragons of the isles, and corrupted it into a human sacrifice ritual, offering
blood to some unknowable god in exchange for protection from the riftscape (this is entirely superstitious, and does not actual have a tangible effect) 

A number of Xeres Reborn settlements at the edges of their territory have made agreements with the local Xhal'fae to provide living human sacrifices as tribute every several days, in exchange for their members being safe from the Xhal'fae.

### [Necromancer's County](./necrocounty)

This small township is populated almost entirely by undead, who have all been animated by three journeyman necromancers.
The county itself was wiped out by a plague many years ago, with the necromancers coming later to take advantage of the supply of bodies, as a source of easy labor.

## Other Organizations

### Order of Sion

The Order of Sion is a clandestine organization of users of mental magic, scattered across Eoas and Middha.

The order was founded at the height of the Uon-Eos war, as conflict with the Uon caused ever-increasing increasing distrust of all users of mental magic, driving the more notable practicioners 
and their networks of like-minded mages underground.
Originally, the primary goals of the order were the protection of any at-risk practitioners of mental magic, and preservation of their techniques.
Even though they were distrusted or shunned by most, the order still worked towards Eaosan interests during the war, collecting military intelligence and damping Uon magic.

In the aftermath of the war, the average Eaosian had not become any more accepting of mind magic, so the Order remained underground. Baring an external threat, the Order became ever more self-interested, 
shifting their focus to political influence and espionage. The order now maintains agents in most major governments, subtly working to protect the order and expand its power.
In order to augment their resources, the order also pivoted slightly towards mercenary work - if you know the right person to contact, you may be able hire their unique talents for a considerable fee.
This work mostly political machinations instigated by wealthy lords, but also encompasses the manufacture of scandals, general espionage, and influencing mariages among the high and mighty.

As the most advanced practitioners of mental magic in Eaos, some members of the Order of Sion have abilites that are otherwise unheard of across the continent. This includes the ability to swap minds between bodies,
limited mind control, implantation of false memories, novel forms of illusion, and more. Outside of the Order of Sion, mental magic across Eos is mostly limited to basic (consenual) telepathy, truthsaying, and mental protection.

Note: As they were not touched by the Uon war, the continent of Quon Xi does not have the same reservations against mental magic, and uses it as casually as any other magic.
