# Other Eaosian Fae

## Hyena Tribes

The hyenid 'fae were the last of the  Daal'fae to flee southeast Eaos after the start of the Lich wars, and to this day still roam fairly deep into the Great Desert.
The cataclysm impacted them worse than most Daal'fae groups, wiping out several tribes and pushing the survivors further into the desert and into more populated regions.  
They most commonly interact with the Lion Tribes, whom they are often in conflict with, and the Riftlanders, who they generally get along with.

Hunter-gatherers, subsisting on just about anything they can scrounge up. Will often travel quite far to find food.

### Sandwalkers

Easternmost Hyenid tribe.
Strong tradition of necromancy

Anyone who dies in the tribe is reanimated as a zombie.
These do much of the manual labor, especially scouting and building.

Relatively small population, as resources are scarce in the desert.

### Those Who Remain

Loose collection of Hyenid tribes to the far south, on the edge of the riftscape, made up of fragmented remnants of the tribes who lived in the area prior to the cataclysm.
Some intermingling with nearby canid tribes who were similarly affected.
Decent relation with the riftlanders - while they don't actually interact mutch, the respect each other and will provide mutual aid when needed.

Mostly subsist on shorecomber crabs and other sealife found along the coast of the rift.

#### Wall of the Ancestors

Prior to the Uon Cataclysms, the Valley of the Ancestors (as it was known then) was a sacred site for many different Hyenid tribes. Statues were carved on the walls of a great stone canyon. 
These walls were riddled with caves and carved stone passages, which held the mummified remains of their ancestors, going back two thousand years.

During the cataclysm, this site was destroyed. The largest surviving fragment is found on an isolated fragment of land on the outer edge of the riftscape, and holds most of one wall of the valley, facing the rift.
Those Who Remain are in the process of restoring this site, and connectiung it to the mainland.

###

Loose collection of smaller tribes that are culturally quite similar, spread across the southern great plains
All together, they make up the largest population of Hyenid fae in Dael.

They frequently practice temporary reanimation (often of the null zombie variety), both to more easily bring prey back to their settlement and for assistance in combat.

#### Northern

Frequntly come into conflict with Leonine fae, usually by stealing their kills.

#### Central

Trap hunters - drive herds of ... off cliffs and such
After especially successful hunts, usually share bounty with other ___ tribes.

#### Western

Regularly raid outlying regions surrounding Vindel and Grandel, stealing livestock, grain, and the occational trinkets.
Have a more diverse diet than most Hyenid tribes, and a somewhat more flamboyant taste in ornamentation.


## Lion Tribes

The Leonine Daal'fae tribes are spread throughout the central Great Plains. They survive mostly through hunting the wildlife of the plains.

While they have a strong internal sense of community, they are extreemly hostile towards outsiders, especially non-fae. 
This attitude is a large part of the reason why there aren't many Ael'daal settlements east of the Great River.

### Central Mesa Pride

Largest Lion Tribe.

Based out of a fortified citatel atop an isolated mesa in the center-east great plains.
Traditionalist and isolationist.

Neutrality agreement with the Great Plains Tribe, whom they recive various worked goods from.

Frequently in conflict with various Hyenid tribes to the south and east, and Canid tribes to the north and west.
Occasional conflict with other lion tribes to the north and south.
