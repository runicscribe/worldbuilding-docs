# Former Nations

As history has wound its ways, many nations have rose and fell. Most have left their mark on Dael in one way or another.

## Uon Collective

The Uon shared a collective conciousness, and as such have organized themselves as a single cultural and political entity for their entire history as a nation, rougly 50,000 years.
The contemporary form of the Uon collective emerged in a couple millenia after the Ael-Dragon war, as the Uon slowly rebuilt their civilization after being nearly eradicated. 
Part of this rebuilding involved significant developments in magic and pseudo-industrialization.

From an outside perspective, Uon culture appears hierarchical, with the majority of the population comprised of menials/workers, responsible for agriculture, construction, and powering large magical workings. 
The higher echelons of this hiearchy are include overseers, researchers, and focci for magical workings (enchanters, architects, priests/magi, and warlords).

Because Uon minds are less tethered to their bodies than is typical for other peoples, the reality is a little more complex - many labourer bodies may only be controlled by a handful of minds, 
while higher-echelon individuals may actualy be controlled or advised by many minds (this is especially common for mage-focci and warlords, who draw on the power and conciousnesses of many individuals to accomplish feats 
that would otherwise be impossible for a single person). This also means killing an individual leader or warrior is almost entirely useless, as their mind(s) will just move to a different body.

The Uon also take slaves of other peoples for use as basic menial labor and arcane power sources.

The collective makes heavy use joint magical workings in construction. As a consequence, their cities are precisely organized and somewhat modular. Many cities look nearly identical, 
especially those raised times of conflict, on the Xuon and Eaos mainland. Older Uon cities, near where their civilization began, are rather more varied.

Cities are constructed out of large contiguous stone blocks, with magically-hollowed interiors.
Because Uon 'see' using magic rather than natural sight, Uon clothing and architecture looks strange to outsiders.
This is exemplified by a complete lack of dyes and paint, with any ornamentation being achieved by mixing different materials through inlays or carving.
This can lead to unusual color combinations, or structures that are made up of many different materials yet remain nearly monochrome.

The Uon have no written history, and relied instead on their collective conciousness. Writing is limited to signage and magical inscriptions.

The Uon Collective ended when all Uon people were destroyed during the Uon cataclysm.

## Xeres Empire

### Formation

During the dragon war in the fifth millenia BC, the inhabitants of Xuon, both Ael and Uon, were decimated.
The Uon went into hiding, while the Ael parlayed with the dragons. Out of this came an aggreement - in excange for their continued existance, the Ael'xhal would serve the dragons.
On the side of the dragons these negotiations were headed by strong but young dragon named Xeres, who claimed a fertile valley as his territory.

The service the Ael took the form of tributes - gold, gems, livestock, or even humans - offered to the ruling dragon of the region.
Often this tribute was tied less to the dragons desires, and more to what they belived would keep their human subjects in line.
Xeres in particular believed in rule by fear, and demanded a still-beating human heart at noon every day.

The need to keep the dragons sated drove the Ael to rapidly grow their civilization, in order to be able to sustainably meet the demands placed upon them.
This eventually led to conflict between different groups of Ael (which the dragons ignored, as long as the tribute kept flowing)
A few hundered years after the end of the dragon war, most of the setlements on the east cost had formed into an empire, with its capitol in Xeres' valley.

### Architecture, Customs, and Technology.

Large cities adorned in gold.
Sacrifice of gold, gems, livestock, and sometimes humans. (At central temple - step pyramid, but octagonal or circular)

At its peak - continent-spanning trade, agriculture
Tall spires and gliders (augmented by draconic magic?).
Sub-nations divided by which dragon's teritorry they live in (Xuon - hosted 100 - 300 dragons total during this time period)

### Decline

Started to fall appart due to internal rebellion around 3100 BC
Xhal'fae rose out of crumbling empire, as many of the rebelling 'xhal reverted to smaller settlements deep in the jungle

The last vestiges of the empire, including Xeres himself, fell during the conflict between the Ael'Xhal and the expanding Uon Collective.

Some hidden enclaves inhabiting the ruins of the Empire's once-great cities still keep to the old ways, but no longer have the connectedness of a true empire

## First Quon Xi Dynasty

## Aelmos Empire

Centered in what is now the great Eos desert. It collapsed during the Lich wars, and later destroyed by the ongoing conflict.

The desert now hosts numerous ruins - mostly tombs or mausoloeams. Obelisks and large statues are common. 
Step pyramids are rare but present. Tombs usually have undead guardians (zombies + a sleep/wake spell. 
Many tombs in the southwest feature ornate animal death masks. Some tombs house liches.

## Kingdom of Al-Enjat

Largely stable since before the Lich wars.

Heavily impacted by the Uon-Daal war, and then destroyed completely during the Uon cataclysm
Refugees from the war and survivors of the cataclysm joined the Tehktun Islands Collective to form the Enjat-Tehktun Alliance
