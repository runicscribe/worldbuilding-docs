# Religions

There are a vast array of religions in Dael.
Some of these venerate beings who exist, others focus on mythological figures or unknowable gods.

The largest religions are:
 - The Church of Daelios
 - The Arcane Trinity
 - The Futhern Mythos
 - Kaldhaism

## Eaos

The early religions of the Eoasian Daal were polytheistic.
None of these religions have survived to the current day, but many themes and deities can be seen in aspects of the modern Eaosian religions.

### Dalean Mythos

Unique to the Sach'ean Diarchy.
Closest remnant of early Eaos religion, and oldest living religion. 
Larger emphasis on various water-affiliated gods. Some hints of 'jinn religion and  

### The Church of Daelios

The largest active religion in central Eaos, worshipping the Sun-god Daelios.
Traditional and unassuming. 
Youngest of the widely practiced organized religions in Dae'Machina, although still over 2000 years old. 

Daelios is primarly associated with growth, harvest, and prosperity.
The primary symbol of the church is an 8-pointed star, with longer vertical and horizontal rays and a hollow center

Nominally monotheistic, but does not condemn the worship of other gods.

Northern Eoasians are more likely to worship one of the Midh religions.

### Ekatlien's Children

First Era Eaos deity and patron of refugees and migrants
During lich-war exodus, and spawned a splinter-religion of her own, which persists to this day.
Mainly charity, sanctuary, and orphanages, along with funerary rites.

One of the few Ael'daal religions with a relatively large following among the 'fae.

Largest presence in the southern free cities and the Enjat-Tehktun Alliance
Smaller followings among Shapeshifter commune (and southern 'fae caravans), Riftlanders, and Hollow cities, and Teythmos

Patron-deity of the city of Haven.

### Cult of Aphelia

The Cult of Aphelia is an Eaosian sex cult, most prominent in coastal and southern Elyos. Its members mostly consist of middle and upper-class Eaosians.
It is organized into small sects. Membership in a sect is secret, even from other members.

### Lich Cults

Small number of cults with the goal of freeing the surviving liches of the lich wars.

### Daal'fae Mythology

The Daal'fae of central Eaos share a mythology based mainly in Animal Spirtitualism, with most deities being an avatar of some animal.
Some elder fae also show up occasionally as minor deities in myths. Daal'fae constellations are closely tied to these myths.

Many ursine Midh'fae also subscribe to this mythology. 

### Riftlanders

Many riftlanders hold to the religion of their parents.

#### Children of the Rift

Some second-generation Riftlanders have started a fairly popular folk religion venerating the riftscape itself, and featuring figures based upon Uon statues found in the ruins of their citadels.
Central themes revolve around not falling victim to hubris, which is both thematically appropriate to the fallen Uon, and good advice for people who regularly venture into the most dangerous magical anomaly on Dael.

Most non-Riftlander Eoasians (and many first-generation riftlanders) consider this religion to be heretical, given everything that happended during the Uon war.

### Ael'jinn

Revere the Elder 'jinn as demigods, especially the founders of New Aelmos.
The fact that some of them are still alive makes this a rather unconventional religion.

Close descendants of the Elder are considered to have divine blood, and inate right of rule.

## Mhidda

The Ael'midh do not have any single strongly organized religion, and instead follow various folk-deities with different traits and relative importance depending on region.
The 'fae of Mhidda mostly follow the a similar mythos, except for the ursine 'fae, whos beliefs are more inline with the Daal'fae, and certain groups of selkies

### Futhern Mythos

The mythology and pantheon of the the Drakkar clans and Futhern Dal have significant overlap, but the importance of various deityies vary greatly between the two.
The Drakkar are much more about a glorious death to secure a place in the afterlife, wherease the Furthern Dal have a focus on funerary rites and elaborate monuments.

The canine Midh'fae follow a similar mythology, but venerate a Wolf-god over all the others.
Some selkies also follow this mythology.

### Dhagian Mythology

The Dhagian have an entirely unique pantheon to the Midh (barring a handful of myths where midh gods show up as antagonists), 
but their religion is otherwise thematically quite similar to the Drakkar, with the exception of funerary rites, which tend towards natural burial.

Some Selkies living on the Dhagian isles also prescribe to this mythology

### Selkie Beast-cults

A number of Selkies tribes follow a various beast-cults (Dragon, Giant Squid, Wurm, Leviathan), generally venerating an actual living creature.

### Dragonfire Exalted

The Dragonfire Exalted is a cult / folk-religion venerating the Lord of Ironfire Citadel. It has gradually coalesced since the founding of the city.

The mythology of this relligion borrows heavily from Midh legends, particularly their myths about dragons, but turns them around so that the midh gods are the antagonists rather than the dragons.
Unlike other dragon-worshipping religions, this was not started by the dragon it venerates, but rather grew organically among the human inhabitants of the city.

It puts particular importance on smiths and crafters, and on fire. Devotees typically have a brand of the church's symbol somewhere on their body, and are traditionally cremated upon death. 
The religion is mostly isolated to Ironfire citedal, and even there it has few followers. A small scattering of followers can be found outside the city, typically descendants of people who lived in Ironfire citadel in ages past.


## Kita Lau and Xuon

The religious landscape of the Xhal has been moulded by three millenia of draconic rule, such that most religions are either an offshot of the Xeres Orthodoxy, or in direct opposition to it.
A notable outlier are the feline Xhal'fae, who are largely areligious

### Xeres Orthodoxy

Founded on the concept that dragons are physical gods.
Creation mythos are a retelling of the dragon war. Draconic leaders of various Xeres Empire cities feature in their own myths.


Core themes are Dragons are superiour to humans and deserving of worship and tribute.

After the fall of the Xeres empire in BC 2,500, the orthodoxy broke up into many independant dragon cults. Only a handful of these have survived into the modern era.
Several of these have kept the trappings and rituals of the orthodoxy, but now venerate other creatures, like the great sea-beasts.
The Xeres Reborn are one of the largest such remenants, although their practices and beliefs have diverged significantly from the Orthodoxy.

#### Followers of the Twofold Path

The religion of the Dragonhalls is technicaly an offshoot of the Xeres Orthodoxy, although they would be considered heretics by the Xeres.
Much less severe than the Orthodoxy, and focused rather more on the founders of Dragonhalls, but retains many of the underlying myths.

Core themes are Dragons are more powerfull than humans, so you should cooperate with them to build great works together.

#### Cult of Atrefax

A remnant of the Xeres Orthodoxy following one of few remaining dragons who kept up the old ways after the fall of the Xeres empire. 
Relatively isolated population of Xhal.
It is the clossest living religion to the original orthodoxy.

### Heralds of Alutcha

The Heralds of Alutcha is a religion which formed as a direct refutation of the Xeres Orthodoxy, decrying all dragonkind as enemies of humanity.
They are monotheistic, worshiping Alutcha, a prophesized warrior-god who will drive the dragons from the land.

A small number of the Xencha Defiant follow this religion (most Xencha are some variety of atheist)

A significant proportion of the Heralds allied with the Uon in early stages of the Uon-'Xhal war, in the hope that the Uon would eliminate the dragons. This sect has since gone extinct.
The largest extant branch exists in western Kita Lau, and is somewhat at odds with the Heartland religions of Quon Xi.

### Five Truths of the Isles

Polytheistic, small pantheon. Old.
Gods:
 - Nagra - Volcano/Life/Renewal
 - Vushu - Sea/Weather/Mystery
 - Ulua - Coast/River/Prosperity
 - Sezetch - Night/Shadow/Death
 - Fengrax - Jungle/Balance/Pleasure
 
Many Xhao'fae, some coastal mer'fae, and some Ael'Xhal, including a moderate following among the Enjat-Tehktun Alliance

#### Duality of Vache-Setch

Merfae variant of the five truths, most common among deep ocean merfae and in the Sach'ean Diarchy
Only recognizes the sea-god Vache as their prime god and the shadow-god Setch, as the adversary.

### Followers of Leviathan

The other main religion of the Mer'fae found off the coast of Kita Lau and Eaos.
Venerates leviathans as physical gods - typically each group worships (and lives around) a specific leviathan.

## Quon Xi

### Heartland

Since the First Dynasty, the people of the Heartland have followed a creed which values above all honor, ancestory, and purity.
Loss of honor - through betrayal, failure, or selfishness - coresponds to loss of station, and the honor of parents caries on to their children.
In this way, the society of the empire has a form of caste system, albeit one with a fair amount of vertical mobility.

Most don't consider these practuces to be a religion per se, as it venerates no higher powers, except perhaps the empire itself, and has no mythos of its own.
However, within the framework set out by these practices there does exist various smaller religions, venerating an array different of ancestors-gods, thereby echoing the importance of lineage enshrined by the creed.

This doctrine explicitly excludes anyone who isn't 'thal, so any 'xhal, 'fae, or 'jinn which live in the heartland exist on the fringes of society.
Outside the heartland, sentiments are somewhat more relaxed.

#### Order of the Selfless

Monastic order.
Anyone can join, but in doing so permanently renounce their place in society. Joining bestows honor on the rest of their family
Members of the order are forbidden from having children.

Generally, members of the order perform acts of charity and community service
Specific practices and trappings vary depending upon region.

Frequently run orphanages.
May also run schools, public libraries, hospitals, and such.

The order is often finacially supported by the empire.

### Children of the Valley

Pacifist order that has existed since the Ael-Dragon war, centered around the Queen's Valley. Many members never leave the valley.

Does not recruit much, instead relying upon like-mindeded individuals to find their way to the valley.
Non members are not permitted in the heart of the valley - this restriction is enforced by the Queen of the Valley herself.

Druids of the order travel across Quon Xi, protecting nature and healing the sick, and bring news of the world back to the Queen of the Valley.
Has a high number of 'jin and 'fae members.

The Quon Xi empire considers the order mostly harmless, and generally allows its druids free passage.


### Western Regions

The southwest regions of Quon Xi hase less integrated with the heartland, and are host to a number of their own quite popular religions.


#### Kaldhaism

Originated on the southwest coast of Quon Xi, but practiced throughout the southern valleys as well.
There are a variety of practices and rituals which fall under this label, but they all share much of the same myths.

Common themes include community, mindfullness, and the idea that good things come to those who do good.

#### Mountain Ascetecism

Maintain temples along the mountains between southern valleys dedicated to <>, god of the wind and patron of travellers.
Maintain routes through the mountains and serve as a rest spot for travelers between valleys. Without their efforts, travell between valleys would be much more difficult.
Subsist on tithes from neighboring vilages

In addition to the temple keepers, some devotees travel across the land carrying news.

##### Path of the Wing <Thal'fae splinter>

Nominally under the mantle of <patron of travellers>, and share the garb of travelling monks, although this is at least partly

##### Path of Wind and Water <Quon Xi 'jinn splinter>

Many Quon Xi 'jinn take on the garb of the ascetics, to move more freely among the 'thal.


### Northern Tundra

The northern regions of Quon Xi hosts a wide variety of folk religions, variously honoring great wariors, explorers, and mythological beasts.
There are also a handful of more sinister cults devoted ancient beasts of the sea and snow.


## Other Religions

### Heartbeat of the World

Somewhat alien religion followed by some Gyldraeds and Vyldarthe, along with a a very small number of Ael mages and a couple of Dragons.
No specific gods. Mainly concerned with the flow of Arcana across Dael.

### The Arcane Trinity

Originated with the Ael'daal during the first Eaos Empire. Mostly recognized by Eaos-Mhidda mages at present..
No specific practices or rituals, but does have a host of deities, personifying fundamental forces.

Recognizes three deities which govern immutable laws of reality and forces that cannot be tampered with by magic 
(Life, death, luck/chaos, magic, etc.).

#### Veil

Veil governs the genesis of new life and its ultimate end. It is also associated with Gateways, Discovery and Loss, Forgetting and Remembering, Dawn and Dusk.

Veil is rarely worshipped directly. Unlike the other two, Veil frequently shows up in other Eaos-Mhidda religions.

#### Gyldra
Gyldra is the God of the Earth, Nature, Life, and the Natural Order. She is most commonly depicted as a feminine dryad composed of earth, stone, water, and plantlife, and cloaked in clouds.

## Other Mythological Figures

### Eldar Ascended

Many ancient immortals have become mythological figures in their own right.
With the exception of the Eldar 'jinn, they are not usually worshiped directly, more often appearing in myths as folk heroes or bogeymen.

#### Queen of Ravens

Sometimes venerated as a death-god.
