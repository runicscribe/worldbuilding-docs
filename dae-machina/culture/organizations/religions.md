# Religions

## The Church of Daelios

The main church of Eaos, worshipping the Sun-god Daelios.
Traditional and unassuming. 
Youngest of the widely practiced organized religions in Dae'Machina, although still over 2000 years old. 

Daelios is primarly associated with growth, harvest, and prosperity.
The primary symbol of the church is an 8-pointed star, with longer vertical and horizontal rays and a hollow center

Northern Eoasians are more likely to worship one of the Midh religions.

## Midh

Not strongly organized, consists mainly of Folk-deities with different traits and relative importance depending on region.

## Fae

Animal Spiritualism
Elder fae occasionally show up as minor deities in myths
Midh-fae mostly follow Midh religon, although venerate (Wolf-god) over the others.

## Riftlanders

Many riftlanders hold to the religion of their parents.

### Children of the Rift

Some have started a fairly popular folk religion venerating the riftscap itself, and featuring figures based upon Uon statues found in the ruins of their citadels.
Central themes revolve around not falling victim to hubris, which is both thematically appropriate to the fallen Uon, and good advice for people who regularly venture into the most dangerous magical anomaly on Dael.


## Xhal

### Xeres Orthodoxy

Founded on the concept that dragons are physical gods.
Creation mythos are a retelling of the dragon war. Draconic leaders of various Xeres Empire cities feature in their own myths.
Mostly extinct after fall of Xeres empire - Xeres Reborn have retained some of the trappings.

Core themes are Dragons are superiour to humans and deserving of worship and tribute.

#### 

The religion of the Dragonhalls is technicaly an offshoot of the Xeres Orthodoxy, although they would be considered heretics by the Xeres.
Much less severe than the Orthodoxy, and focused rather more on the founders of Dragonhalls, but retains many of the underlying myths.

Core themes are Dragons are more powerfull than humans, so you should cooperate with them to build great works together.

## Other Mythological Figures

### Eldar Ascended

Many ancient immortals have become mythological figures in their own right.
They are not usually worshiped directly, more often appearing in myths as folk heroes or bogeymen.

### Deities

Deities are personifications of fundamenal forces. They may or may not actually exist and never manifest physically. Deities govern immutable laws of reality and forces that cannot be tampered with by magic 
(Life, death, luck/chaos, magic, etc.).
They are not worshipped by all religions, but feature in many. Most practicing mages recognize them as gods, as they are associated with certain limitations of magic (creation or restoration of life, manipulation of luck).

Many powerfull ascended are worshipped as gods, but do not actually qualify as Deities.
