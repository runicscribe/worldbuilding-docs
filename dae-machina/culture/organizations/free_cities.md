# Free Cities

The *Free Cities* (also called "The Eight" or "The Eight Lordships") are a series of loosly affiliated city-states along the Great Eaos River.
This river is readily traversible and forms the backbone of trade across central Eaos.
It is roughly 3000km long and takes 4-8 weeks to traverse by boat (depending upon whether you are travelling up or downstream)

Methods of government vary between cities, although most are ruled by one person, generally a Lord or Guildmaster. 
A council of Leaders from each city meets monthly to settle disputes and govern trade (and other interactions) between cities. There is frequent espionage and minor conflicts between cities (“squabbling”). 
Varying amounts of corruption, smuggling and counter-espionage among the cities. The free cities are home to a wide and varied mix of peoples. 

The Free Cities are politically seperate from the Elyos Republic, althrough relations are generally cordial between the two. Given their influence on trade, 
any conflict with the Free Cities would have the potential to economically cripple the republic.

The free cities were originally part of the Elyos Republic, but became independant during the Uon-'daal war, sometime after the Elyos capital was moved north to Teylmos.

## Eosport

The "face" of the free cities. Not the most wealthy or influential, but still quite important. Contains the meeding place for the free cities council.
Generally agreed upon as neutral ground among the cities. 
Eosport is also the primary port of travel between the free cities and Teythmos, and hosts embassies for a number of nations.
It is partly built on the ruins of the former Elyos capital, which was abandoned during the Uon war.

### Layout

The city layout roughly follows that of the ruins it was built on top of.
The main city is built on the southeast coast of the river, and divided into three tiers, each being further inland and higher in elevation.
These tiers are connected by three broad avenues, radiating from the city center.
 - The first tier is the main working hub of the city, consisting primarly of docks and warehouses.
 - The second tier is the middle city, with inns, merchants and marketplacess, dwellings, and artisans.
 - The third tier is the domain of the higher classes, containing manor houses of lords and wealthy merchants, embassies, banks, and select luxury shops.

The city center is about 1.5 km inland, and includes various government buildings, with the Council of Lords at the center, where the eight lords of the Free Cities council meet.

On the opposute coast of the river are slums, housing much of the cities poorer residents.
About 2km upstream of the main city is the Tower Bridge, connecting the two shores.
There are also a number of ferry crossings closer to the core city.

## Blackport

The "shady" city. Most illicit or morally dubious trade goes through Blackport. This includes drugs derived from swamp plants, slaves from the xhal isles, and any other goods 
that would be difficult to pass through Eosport or Haven. Rarely, this includes dangerous magical artifacts from the riftscape.

The common wisdom is that you can get anything in Blackport, for the right price.

The main city of Blackport is on a crescent-shaped rocky isle at the mouth of the river delta, and is not directly connected to the mainland. The surrounding swamps are quite difficult to traverse, making the city especually isolated.
There are some fishermen and farmers along the banks of the river, but Blackport primarilly relies on trade for food.

## Haven

The third city at the mouth of the Great Eaos river and adjacent to Trader's Bay. Most of the bulk trade between Tethmos and the free cities goes through Haven. 
The city also hosts many shipyards, which source wood from all along the river. 
The city gets it's name from the fact that it is a safe harbour for slaves escaping Blackport and its environs.

## Bridgeport

Bridgeport stradles the river just before it splits into the three tributaries that feed Trader's Bay. Consequently, it controls all trade that passes up or down the river (and benefits from all the resulting tarifs)
Some illicit trade from Blackport passes through Bridgeport, expediated by hefty bribes to the right officials. However, most of the more blatantly illegal trade (slaves, certain drugs) is not tolerated at any price 
(although these are sometimes smuggled through anyways). 

Since it straddles the river, it is also a major hub of ground-based trade through central Eaos.

## Elgate

Elgate is a smaller city between Bridgeport, Eosport, and Haven. It subsits almost solely on income from tariffs and travellers (lodging, etc.). 
The city is on the same delta as Eosport, and there is a little-travelled ground path between them.

## Vindel

Vindel is upriver of Bridgeport, on the northwest bank. It serves as a hub for many vinyards and other farms in the area, and is generally considered to produce the best wine in the region. 
Ships goods overland to Elyos, as well as up and down-river.
The farms and vinyards that feed Vindel overlap the borders of Elyos (even moreso than most of the Free Cities), but in practice they fall under the domain of Vindel.

## Grandel

Grandel is Vindel's sister city. It is located in the center of a large swath of farmland, especially grain. The city produces a significant percent of the Free Cities food supplies, and also ships food overland to other regions.
Like Vindel, the surrounding farmland extends into Elyos but still effectively belongs to the city.
In addition to food, Grandel produces wines, textiles, and other goods. It is the furthest upriver of the major free cities.

## Kenford

This city straddles the river between Vindel and Grandel, and benefits from trade both up and down river.
In addition to being a notable trade center (comparable to Eaosport, but not quite at large as Bridgeport or Haven), the city is also a respectable hub of magic.
It hosts a guild of mages, not beholden to the Elyos empire (unlike the AoM&MA).

Prior to the Uon War, Kenford was a small port city between Vindel and Grandel, of little renown. Afther the Free Cities split from the Elyos Republic in the aftermath of the war, it came under the leadership of a renowned
Mage-general, who founded the Kenford Mages Guild, significantly increasing the cities importance. It is currently ruled by his son.

## Others

There are a number of smaller towns up and down river. These are much less important then the eight main cities, and are typically beholden to one of them. 
For the most part, they are located about a days travel (by river) from the next nearest city, and partly serve as rest points.

Armuth and The Academy of Magical and Martial Arts are both near the mouth of the great Eos river, but are not counted among them, as they are very much a part of the Elyos republc.
