# Free Cities

The *Free Cities* (also called "The Eight" or "The Eight Lordships") are a series of loosly affiliated city-states along the Great Eaos River.
This river is readily traversible and forms the backbone of trade across central Eaos.

The Free Cities are politically seperate from the Elyos Republic, althrough relations are generally cordial between the two. Given their influence on trade, 
any conflict with the Free Cities would have the potential to economically cripple the republic.

The free cities were originally part of the Elyos Republic, but became independant during the Uon-'daal war, sometime after the Elyos capital was moved north to Teylmos.

## Eosport

The "face" of the free cities. Not the most wealthy or influential, but still quite important. Contains the meeding place for the free cities council.
Generally agreed upon as neutral ground among the cities. 
Eosport is also the primary port of travel between the free cities and Teylmos, and hosts embassies for a number of nations.
It is partly built on old Eos ruins (possibly the former Elyos capital?)

## Blackport

The "shady" city. Most illicit or morally dubious trade goes through Blackport. This includes drugs derived from swamp plants, slaves from the xhal isles, and any other goods 
that would be difficult to pass through Eosport or Haven. Rarely, this includes dangerous magical artifacts from the riftscape.

The common wisdom is that you can get anything in Blackport, for the right price.

The main city of Blackport is on a rocky isle at the mouth of the river delta, and is not directly connected to the mainland. The surrounding swamps are quite difficult to traverse, making the city especually isolated.
There are some fishermen and farmers along the banks of the river, but Blackport primarilly relies on trade for food.

## Haven

The third city at the mouth of the Great Eaos river and adjacent to Trader's Bay. Most of the bulk trade between Tethmos and the free cities goes through Haven. 
The city also hosts many shipyards, which source wood from all along the river. 
The city gets it's name from the fact that it is a safe harbour for slaves escaping Blackport and its environs.

## Bridgeport

Bridgeport stradles the river just before it splits into the three tributaries that feed Trader's Bay. Consequently, it controls all trade that passes up or down the river (and benefits from all the resulting tarifs)
Some illicit trade from Blackport passes through Bridgeport, expediated by hefty bribes to the right officials. However, most of the more blatantly illegal trade (slaves, certain drugs) is not tolerated at any price 
(although these are sometimes smuggled through anyways). 

Since it straddles the river, it is also a major hub of ground-based trade through central Eaos.

## Elgate

Elgate is a smaller city between Bridgeport, Eosport, and Haven. It subsits almost solely on income from tariffs and travellers (lodging, etc.). 
The city is on the same delta as Eosport, and there is a little-travelled ground path between them.

## Vindel

Vindel is upriver of Bridgeport, on the northwest bank. It serves as a hub for many vinyards and other farms in the area, and is generally considered to produce the best wine in the region. 
Ships goods overland to Elyos, as well as up and down-river.
The farms and vinyards that feed Vindel overlap the borders of Elyos (even moreso than most of the Free Cities), but in practice they fall under the domain of Vindel.

## Grandel

Grandel is Vindel's sister city. It is located in the center of a large swath of farmland, especially grain. The city produces a significant percent of the Free Cities food supplies, and also ships food overland to other regions.
Like Vindel, the surrounding farmland extends into Elyos but still effectively belongs to the city.
In addition to food, Grandel produces wines, textiles, and other goods.

## Kenford

This city straddles the river between Vindel and Grandel, and benefits from trade both up and down river. 
It was founded by a renowned Mage-general of the Uon-'daal war, and is currently ruled by his son.

In addition to being a notable trade center (comparable to Eaosport, but not quite at large as Bridgeport or Haven), the city is also a respectable hub of magic.
It hosts a guild of mages, not beholden to the Elyos empire (unlike the AoM&MA). 

## Others

There are a number of smaller towns up and down river. These are much less important then the eight main cities, and are typically beholden to one of them.

Armuth and The Academy of Magical and Martial Arts are both near the mouth of the great Eos river, but are not counted among them, as they are very much a part of the Elyos republc.
