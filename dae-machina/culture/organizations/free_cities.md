# Free Cities

The *Free Cities* (also called "The Eight" or "The Eight Lordships") are a series of loosly affiliated city-states along the Great Eaos River.
This river is readily traversible and forms the backbone of trade across central Eaos.
It is roughly 3000km long and takes 4-8 weeks to traverse by boat (depending upon whether you are travelling up or downstream)

Methods of government vary between cities, although most are ruled by one person, generally a Lord or Guildmaster. 
A council of Leaders from each city meets monthly to settle disputes and govern trade (and other interactions) between cities. There is frequent espionage and minor conflicts between cities (“squabbling”). 
Varying amounts of corruption, smuggling and counter-espionage among the cities. The free cities are home to a wide and varied mix of peoples. 

The Free Cities are politically seperate from the Elyos Republic, althrough relations are generally cordial between the two. Given their influence on trade, 
any conflict with the Free Cities would have the potential to economically cripple the republic.

The free cities were originally part of the Elyos Republic, but became independant during the Uon-'daal war, sometime after the Elyos capital was moved north to Teylmos.

## Eosport

<img src="/dae-machina/images/eaosport_map_lb.png" alt="Top-down map of Eaosport" class="img-dm img-right">

The "face" of the free cities. Not the most wealthy or influential, but still quite important. Contains the meeding place for the free cities council.
Generally agreed upon as neutral ground among the cities. 
Eosport is also the primary port of travel between the free cities and Teythmos, and hosts embassies for a number of nations.
It is partly built on the ruins of the former Elyos capital (New Aelmos, not to be confused with the 'jinn city of the same name) which was abandoned in 100 BC, during the Uon war.

### Layout

The city layout roughly follows that of the ruins it was built on top of.
The main city is built on the southeast coast of the river, and divided into three tiers, each being further inland and higher in elevation.
These tiers are connected by three broad avenues, radiating from the city center.
 - The first tier is the main working hub of the city, consisting primarly of docks and warehouses.
 - The second tier is the middle city, with inns, merchants and marketplacess, dwellings, and artisans.
 - The third tier is the domain of the higher classes, containing manor houses of lords and wealthy merchants, embassies, banks, and select luxury shops.

The city center is about 1.5 km inland, and includes various government buildings, with the Council of Lords at the center, where the eight lords of the Free Cities council meet.

On the opposute coast of the river are slums, housing much of the cities poorer residents.
About 2km upstream of the main city is the Tower Bridge, connecting the two shores.
There are also a number of ferry crossings closer to the core city.

## Blackport

The "shady" city. Most illicit or morally dubious trade goes through Blackport. This includes drugs derived from swamp plants, slaves from the xhal isles, and any other goods 
that would be difficult to pass through Eosport or Haven. Rarely, this includes dangerous magical artifacts from the riftscape.

The common wisdom is that you can get anything in Blackport, for the right price.

The main city of Blackport is on a crescent-shaped rocky isle at the mouth of the river delta, and is not directly connected to the mainland. The nearest coast is full of impassible swampland, making the city especually isolated.
There are some fishermen and farmers along the banks of the river, but Blackport primarilly relies on trade for food.

Most of Blackport's residants live on the inner edge of the isle. At the midpoint is the Citidel, where the Lord of Blackport and supporting functionaries live and work.  

### The Lord of Blackport

There is a great deal of politicking and backstabing within the Citadel, so the Lord of Blackport changes fairly frequently.
They tend to be primarly skilled in politics and espionage rather than magic or force of arms.

The Lord of Blackport has direct authority over the Shadowsteel Guard and Citadel Staff.
Typically goes about robed and masked when outside the citadel, so than no-one outside the guard and staff know quite how often leadership of the city changes.

### Shadowsteel Company

The Shadowsteel Company is a mercenary company based out of Blackport. While their services are for-hire, they are still largely under the control of the Lord of Blackport.
The company is equiped with magic-blocking black-iron armor and weapons. They are primarly outfitted with crossbows and halberds.

#### Shadowsteel Guard: 

A branch of the Shadowsteel Company permanently garissoned on Blackport. Members of the company are recruited into the guard based on their loyalty.
They guard the Citadel, and control entry into Blackport Harbor.

### Citadel Staff
Network of clerks, bureaucrats and officials that manage finances, tarrifs, and city operations, as well as facilitating off-island smuggling and procurement through bribes, espionage, and blackmail.
Reports directly to the Lord of Blackport. Most Lords of Blackport are killed by and sourced from the Citadel Staff.

### Yellowjackets
Blackport Harbor Guard. Collects tarifs and maintains order. 
Nominally a branch of the Citadel Staff, though the two groups do not really get along with each other.

### Free-traders Association
Loosly organized collective of pirate captains, established to provide greater negotiating power with the Citadel. Controlls piracy, smuggling, and transport to and from the citadel.

### Professional's Office
An independant guild which manages sourcing and contracting assasinations, kidnapping, high-value theft, and other ilicit services

### Records and Tarrifs Office

A large, and fairly brazen guildhouse for the Order of Sion.
While it still functions and presents as a records and tarrifs office, it's identity is very much an open secret.
It is not the largest Order of Sion office, but it is definitely the least hidden.

### Guild of Dock and Warehouse Workers
A rather well-organized laborer's union, whose power hinges on control of the warehouses (and their contents).
They are tolerated by the citadel because they can play the guild off of the free-traders association to avoid either group establishing too much power.

### Hospitality Guild
Collective of inkeepers with control over inns and lodging, but also safehouses, trafficking, and prostitution.
Loosly allied with the Free-traders association, with the goal of minimizing Citadel interference.

## Haven

The third city at the mouth of the Great Eaos river and adjacent to Trader's Bay. Most of the bulk trade between Tethmos and the free cities goes through Haven. 
The city also hosts many shipyards, which source wood from all along the river.

It is the oldest of the free cities, founded in 2910 BC by refugees escaping the Lich wars.
While it was named Haven due to the circumstances of its founding, this name has remained accurate in the modern day, where it has served as a refuge for people fleeing the Uon war, 
and more recently as a safe harbour for slaves escaping Blackport and its environs.

## Bridgeport

Bridgeport stradles the river just before it splits into the three tributaries that feed Trader's Bay. Consequently, it controls all trade that passes up or down the river (and benefits from all the resulting tarifs)
Some illicit trade from Blackport passes through Bridgeport, expediated by hefty bribes to the right officials. However, most of the more blatantly illegal trade (slaves, certain drugs) is not tolerated at any price 
(although these are sometimes smuggled through anyways). 

Since it straddles the river, it is also a major hub of ground-based trade through central Eaos.

## Elgate

Elgate is a smaller city between Bridgeport, Eosport, and Haven. It subsits almost solely on income from tariffs and travellers (lodging, etc.). 
The city is on the same delta as Eosport, and there is a little-travelled ground path between them.

## Vindel

Vindel is upriver of Bridgeport, on the northwest bank. It serves as a hub for many vinyards and other farms in the area, and is generally considered to produce the best wine in the region. 
Ships goods overland to Elyos, as well as up and down-river.
The farms and vinyards that feed Vindel overlap the borders of Elyos (even moreso than most of the Free Cities), but in practice they fall under the domain of Vindel.

## Grandel

Grandel is Vindel's sister city. It is located in the center of a large swath of farmland, especially grain. The city produces a significant percent of the Free Cities food supplies, and also ships food overland to other regions.
Like Vindel, the surrounding farmland extends into Elyos but still effectively belongs to the city.
In addition to food, Grandel produces wines, textiles, and other goods. It is the furthest upriver of the major free cities.

## Kenford

This city straddles the river between Vindel and Grandel, and benefits from trade both up and down river.
In addition to being a notable trade center (comparable to Eaosport, but not quite at large as Bridgeport or Haven), the city is also a respectable hub of magic.
It hosts a guild of mages, not beholden to the Elyos empire (unlike the AoM&MA).

Prior to the Uon War, Kenford was a small port city between Vindel and Grandel, of little renown. After the Free Cities split from the Elyos Republic in the aftermath of the war, it came under the leadership of a renowned
Mage-general, who founded the Kenford Mages Guild, significantly increasing the cities importance. It is currently ruled by his son.

### Layout

Kenford is located on the west bank of the Great Eaos River, where a smaller tributary joins the main river.

The east side of the city is dominated by docks for ships traveling up and down the river.
The docks adjoin the **Warehouse District**, containing primarly warehouses, inns, hostels, and brothels. It also hosts the cities customs offices and a Kenford Guard garrison.
West of the warehouse district is the **Merchant's District**, surrounding the main city gate and hosting merchants, various other services like fariers and coopers, and some slightly more upscale inns.
North of these two districts is the local Church of Daelios, and the **Gardens District**, which is a large green space taking up most of the northeast corner of the city.
West of the merchant's district is the **South Quarter**, containing primarly lower-class housing. North of this, seperated by a canal, is the **Middle Quarter**, containing primarly middle-class housing.
Further north, after another canal, is the **Banker's District**. As the name would suggest, this is the financial core of the city, containing banks, moneylenders, and moneychanges, but also the city tax office, foreign affairs offices, several jewelers shops, and the city mint.
The northwest corner of the city is the **West Quarter**, and holds the city's secondary gate, along with a mix of middle-class housing, upscale inns, and miscelaneous merchants. Much of the city's civil service lives in this quarter.
Between the west quarter and the gardens district is the **High Quarter**, containing upper-class housing hand upscale merchant's, and the **Lord's Manor**, housing the lord of the city.

Seperated from the main city by another branch of the tributary river is the mages quarter.
The **Mages Quarter** is the westmost region of the city, and is on its own chunk of land seperated from the main city by another branch of the tributary river.
Three bridges connect it to the rest of the city - one to the south quarter, one to the middle quarter, and one to the bankers district. The quarter also has two gates leading outside the city.
The mages quarter was built after the Uon war and has visibly more modern archtecture than the rest of Kenford. 
This is most noticable in its walls, which are pristine, and have round towers, compared with the sqaure towers and more weathered walls of the rest of the city.

There is also a fair number of buildings outside of the walls south of the city, near the main gate. These are generally considered part of Kenford proper.  

### Kenford Mages Guild

Most renown mages guild of the free cities, though somewhat overshadowed by the Acadomy of Magical and Martial arts.
Unlike the Academy, it is not a magic school, however guildmembers may take apprentices. The guild also provides facilities and resources for members to perform research.

The guild consists of ... buildings. The largest is the main guildhall, which houses ... an extensive library, enchanting and alchemy facilities.
Behind the guildhall is a courtyard with a teleportation circle, enclised by a semicircular building containing housing for visiting guildmembers.
Surrounding the guildhall are a handful of detached buildings for more volatile research.

The guild is located on a seperate island from the rest of Kenford, and connectred to the city by three bridges. This island also houses various buisinesses, and homes for those guildmembers who live in Kenford.


The current guildleader is in her late 50's, and has led the guild for over 20 years. She has a wide range of skills, but is mostly focused on the more subtle magics - scrying, enchanting, illusions, and such.

### Kenford Guard

The Kenford guard is responsible for policing, security, customs, and taxation throughout the city. They report directly to the city's ruler.
Their uniforms consist of a red-dyed leather surcoat with silver detailing and a cloak - grey for regular guards, grey with red trim for lieutenants, and red for captains. This has earned them the moniker "Greycloaks".

The guard includes a disproportionate number of magical adepts, with most of the force having at least some magical talent, and almost half being skilled mages. 
The adepts among the guard wield arcane staves capped in sky-blue crystal in place of spears.

## Others

There are a number of smaller towns up and down river. These are much less important then the eight main cities, and are typically beholden to one of them. 
For the most part, they are located about a days travel (by river) from the next nearest city, and partly serve as rest points.

Armuth and The Academy of Magical and Martial Arts are both near the mouth of the great Eos river, but are not counted among them, as they are very much a part of the Elyos republc.
