# Shapeshifter Commune

Built on ruins of an old Aeldar city, fairly deep into a swampy jungle. Located southwest of Eaos and northwest of the free cities delta
It was originally founded by a couple displaced groups of Daal'fae during the lich wars, as a sanctuary for the fae.
During this time it was primarly a small, hidden refuge. After the lich wars ended and the civilization on the continent began to get back to normal, 
the commune opened up a bit, and became a rest stop for nearby nomadic Daal'fae tribes.

The commune is a sovreign state, independant from its neighbors; the Elyos Republic and the Free Cities. It has remaind independant largely because it is surrounded by quite a lot of very hostile jungle.

Over the years, the settlement has collected an eclectic assortment of fae inhabitants who felt they didn't fit in with their original family, but also didn't feel comfortable in the non-fae Ael cities 
- a mix of midh, daal, and xhaal fae, a variety of half'fae, the occasional half-'jinn, and a handfull Ester's lineage 'jinn, as well as a significant number of varied direbeasts.

The commune also grew substantially during the Uon war, as it took in a large number of Xhal'fae displaced by the conflict. Total pop is still less than 10k, and fairly spread out.

While the commune does not actually forbid regular Ael (at least, not anymore), it is not especially hospitable to them, so only a few especially ecentric individuals live there full time. 
In addition to these, there are a a moderate number of traders who pass through fairly often, drawn by both the various rare and valuable plants found in the jungle, and the other goods brought by the nomadic daal caravans.

The commune has a very different set of rules and assumptions from a normal Ael city, or even a 'fae clan. 
Some have remained more or less unchanged since its founding, while others of these are relatively new, originating from the influx of Xhal'fae.

The commune maintains the 'daal practice of identifying armbands, although has also developed their own system on top of this that also incorporates jewelry in different colors to indicate things such as sexual interest, etc. 
No laws (or even cultural taboos) around nudity. Public sex is permitted (even encouraged), but generally considered as an open invitation to join in. In this aspect, it is even more open than most daal'fae tribes, 
partly due to the influence of the recently arrived xhal'fae.

A ban on grievous violence and murder are the only truly hard laws in the commune. Violations are punished by exile on pain of death. 
A small council is elected to enforce these laws, selected by nomination and confirmed through ritual combat.

About a half-dozen unique and mutually unitellegible languages are spoken, with several more dialects among those. Many inhabitants, only speak one, or sometimes two, of these.
Residents who were born within the commune have a broader range, although mainly native tongue(s) of their parents and one or more of the handfull of mixed dialects unique to the commune.

Council contains at least one representative of each major cultural group.
Due to number of languages, coupled with the fact that most 'fae languages don't have a written form, what signage there is takes the forms of images and pictograms.

Also contributes to things like tryst garden - lacking any one shared language, an established location where consent is implied is useful. 


Culturally, the commune demonstrates an odd mix of collectivism and individuality
Resources like food and water are considered to belong to the community as a whole. Meals are usually taken comunnaly. Monogamy is frowned upon.
Homes and other possesions are considered generally sacrosanct.

## Layout

Old Ael ruins were once a great city, and cover a pretty large region - about 10 km in diameter. 
Given how long since it was founded, the ourter reaches of this area have been entirely reclaimed by the jungle.
While the commune is comparatively sparsely populated, with a population of 5000 - 8000 individuals, it has spread to cover the whole footprint of the original city

The core is a roughly circular 1km walled region at the center of the ruins.
Many of the structures here, including the walls, have been repaired and are relatively well-maintained.
At the center is a large central gathering place, buildt inside the base of a large fallen tower. 
The central gathering is perpetually active, as a significant number of inhabitants are nocturnal or crepuscular.
In addition to communal meals and other civic functions, this area hosts are schools, childcare, social gatherings, and more.
Some of the original Ael aqueducts and sewers within the core ruins has been repaired, giving the city center a half-decent sanitation system.


Southeast rubble from the fallen tower and other buildings, dual purpose as a source of stone for repairing, and a dumping ground for stone rubble from other parts of the city.
While most of the original tower rubble has long since been used up, it has remained a source of stone due to dumping.

West of center is a old amphitheatre with room for the whole population. It serves as main civic building - announcments, election of council, settlement of disputes, and other functions.

North west, near the wall, is a large cleared area, for hosting visiting caravans and other groups. This area also hosts a large market when visitors are in town.
Most of the commerce occurs within the commune is between it and outsiders - 
Primary market is only active when there is a caravan or other group visiting, as most of the commerce that occurs within the commune is between it and outsiders.

This central area is surrounded by gardens spread throughout the ruins, interspersed with functional buildings.

Within the core city, garden regions are primarly decorative, but also serve social functions, indicated by the colors and types of flowers cultivated within them:
- Baths
- Pursuit of rendezvous. Variety of psycadellic and aphrodesiac plants are also cultivated here.
- Apothecary - More structured than most. 

Outside the core, there are more functional gardens and farms. 

Dwellings are scattered across the outskirts of the ruins, outside of the core.


Outside the walls, river to the east supplies most of the cities fresh water.

The surrounding land, being mainly jungle and swamp, is not well-suited to farming. As such, the diet of the settlement is heavily seafood focused. In part do to the number of inhabitints, 
it is one of the few communities to actively hunt many of the larger ocean denzeins. This meat-based diet is supplemented by produce from visiting daal'fae caravans.
