# Shapeshifter Commune

Built on ruins of an old Aeldar city in a swampy jungle, about 70km inland of the Rift Sea.
Founded by a couple groups of Daal'fae, as a sanctuary for the fae.
Often used as a rest stop by nomadic Daal'fae tribes.
Over the years, the settlement has collected an eclectic assortment of fae inhabitants who felt they didn't fit in with their original family, but also didn't feel comfortable in the non-fae Ael cities 
- a mix of midh, daal, and xhaal fae, a variety of half'fae, the occasional half-'jinn, and a handfull Ester's lineage 'jinn, as well as a significant number of varied direbeasts.

The commune also grew substantially during the Uon war, as it took in a large number of Xhal'fae displaced by the conflict. Total pop is still less than 10k, and fairly spread out.


While the commune does not actually forbid regular Ael, it is not especially hospitable to them, so only a few especially ecentric individuals live there full time. 
In addition to these, there are a a moderate number of traders who pass through fairly often, drawn by both the various rare and valuable plants found in the jungle, and the other goods brought by the nomadic daal caravans.

Very different set of rules and assumptions from a normal Ael city, or even a 'fae clan.
Adopted the 'daal practice of identifying armbands, although have developed their own system on top of this that also incorporates jewelry in different colors to indicate things such as sexual interest, etc. 
No laws (or even cultural taboos) around nudity. 
Public sex is permitted (even encouraged), but generally considered as an open invitation to join in.

A ban on grievous violence and murder are the only truly hard laws in the commune. A small council is elected to enforce these laws, selected by nomination and confirmed through ritual combat.

Culturally, the commune demonstrates an odd mix of collectivism and individuality
Resources like food and water are considered to belong to the community as a whole. Meals are usually taken comunnaly. Monogamy is frowned upon.
Homes and other posessions are considered generally sacrosanct.


Structured as a large central gathering place, with dwellings scattered across the outskirts.
The central gathering is perpetually active, as a significant number of inhabitants are nocturnal or crepuscular.
In addition to communal meals, this area hosts are magic lessons, book clubs, markets (mainly barter), and more.

The surrounding land, being mainly jungle and swamp, is not well-suited to farming. As such, the diet of the settlement is heavily seafood focused. In part do to the number of inhabitints, 
it is one of the few Eaosian communities to actively hunt many of the larger ocean denzeins. This meat-based diet is supplemented by produce from visiting daal'fae caravans.

## History

### Elysium

The ruins the commune is built on were originally a city called Elysium, so named because of the seemingly plentiful natural resources.
It was one of the four great cities founded in 2912 BC by the first big waves of refugees fleeing the lich wars, before the situation in central Eaos became truly dire.
The other three major cities founded at this time were Haven, New Aelmos (not to be confused with the identically named capitol of the 'jinn Principalities, and now known as Eaosport), and ___ (which was located near where the Acadomy of Magical and Martial Arts sits now).

Initially, life was good. The natural resources of the jungle, supplemented with fish from the sea and what food stores the refugees brought with them meant that the first few years were relatively luxurious.
And the city founders began transforming the makeshift settlement into a grand city

However, this didn't last. While natural resources were plentiful, they were being depleted faster than they could be replenished, and soon became insufficient to support the populace.
It was always the plan to clear the jungle to start farms as a more permanent food source, but this was far more difficult in practice. The jungle soil was unsuited to the plains crops brought by the settlers, giving them no chance against the native flora, with newly planted fields being overtaken with weeds in a manner of days. 
Attempts to venture ever deeper into the jungle to harvest yet-untouched regions encountered unexpectedly dangerous creatures. Searches for a wider variety of food sources were to often ended by poisons.

The city founders desperately tried to keep the city fed by importing food with their dwindling stores of wealth, but as food became harder to find the populace dwindled, migrating to more successful settlements to the east.
The city was almost completely abandoned 60 years after its founding, still during the height of the lich wars.

### Founding of the Shapeshifter Commune

Not long after the city was abandonned, a group of 'fae (mainly canine and leonine tribes) who were fleeing the ever-escalating conflict heard about the failed settlement, 
and decided an abandoned city would be a good place to settle where they wouldn't be bothered by non-fae. 
The substantially smaller population and better hunting skills of this group let them be much more successful than the original Ael'daal inhabitants.

### Expansion

The commune remained quite small and entirely self-sufficient for quite some time after this, with fewer than 500 inhabitants.
As the Eaosian civilization re-established itself in the wake of the Lich wars, new settlements and farmland north of the Great Eaos River displaced many of the local Deer 'fae.
Some of these displaced groups joined the shapeshifter commune. Others formed the precursors to the Daal'fae caravans, and helped provide resources to the commune.
This is largely considered to be when the commune moved from being a loose collection of settled 'fae to a true refuge for 'fae of any type.

Far to the west, though in the same jungle, there was already a small established Xhal'fae population, started by 'fae fleeing the Xeres empire.
As this population and that of the commune grew, particularly adventurous members of each occasionally encountered each other. 
From these meetings, the commune very slowly accumulated a small number of Xhal'fae residents.  

The population continued to grow slowly over the next thousand years, taking in displaced 'fae of all backgrounds, and building up the traditions and practices which have persisted into the modern day.
By 1000 BC, the city had a few thousand inhabitants.

### Uon War

As the Uon conquest moved from Xuon to Eaos, the commune continued to recieve a trickle of 'fae refugees displaced by the conflict. 
This grew to a flood in the wake of the Uon cataclysm, which wrecked havoc on sourthern Eaos and the former continent of Xuon. 
Many of the surviving 'fae from both these regions sought out the commune as a temporary refuge. At its peak, the commune hosted nearly 20,000 'fae, along with a few thousand non-'fae Ael. 

Some of these eventually moved on to more permanant homes, but many stayed, and as of 50 AC the population has settled to a little under ten-thousand.
