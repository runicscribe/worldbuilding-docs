# Dragonhalls

Dragonhalls is an extensive chain of human settlements and dragon lairs built into and through the sides of a mountain chain in one of the central Kita Lau islands
Founded during/after the dragon war, by a pair of dragons who mostly wanted to stay out of the whole thing, while still using the influence they had over their territory to protect the local humans.

Dragonhalls has grown extensively throughout the millenia, and now extends across several hundred kilomiters of mountain range, and hosts over a dozen dragons - 
the largest population of dragons in a single place anywhere in the world. The draconic inhabitants consist primarly of the two founders and their children's families. 
However, it has also collected a couple more eccentric dragons who prefer living among humans to the more traditional draconic lifestyle.
A few of these dragons will even deign to be ridden by humans on a regular basis, most often on hunting trips.

Dragonhalls is surrounded by extensive farmland on all sides, both in the surrounding valleys and lowlands, and in terraces up the edges of the mountains.

## Cuisine
It is home to particular unique cuisine, which incorporates quite a lot of megafauna - wurms, levaithans, krakens, etc. 
Harvesting wide-ranging aquatic megafauna is pretty much the only way for this many dragons in one place to be sustainable.

Draconic residents help with the actual hunt, and in turn benifit from somewhat more sophisticated food preparation than is typical for dragons.
Some dragons who don't reside in Dragonhalls sometimes visit just for the food.

## Art and Architecture

Large (15-20 m tall, similar width) pillared halls running the circumference of the mountain range, open to the air on one side.
Suitible for dragons to comfortably pass through (on foot), without crowding out human pedestrians.

Large balconies, making good landing zones.

Bas-releifs, etc.

Several particulalry spectactular public bathouses. 
Most include a section with depth suitable for a dragon, and an equally large section more suited to Ael.
Geothermal heat source.

## History

Dragonhalls was founded in the later stages of the dragon war (5000 BC), by a pair of dragons who mostly wanted to stay out of the whole thing, 
while still using the influence they had over their territory to protect the local humans.

Initially, the two founders (and soon after, their first child) were the only dragons residing in Dragonhalls, but they were shortly joined by a couple other dragons from Xuon, 
who were unsatisfied with the emerging Xeres Empire.

It has maintained a sizeable population ever since. Dragonhalls remained independant during the time of the Xeres Empire, and maintained somewhat more equal relations between dragons and humans during that time.
As a consequence, it served as a haven for refugees from the empire during that time.

The two founders died fighting the Uon in 1500 BC and 90 BC, respectively. However, they were successful in preventing the Uon from establishing a foothold in Kita Lau, and later assisted in the later stages of the conflict in Eaos.
The current leader of Dragonhalls is the second child of the founders.

In modern times, Dragonhalls boasts the closest relations between dragons and humans anywhere in the world.
