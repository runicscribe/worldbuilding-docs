# Dragonhalls

Dragonhalls is an extensive chain of human settlements and dragon lairs built into and through the sides of a mountain chain in one of the central Kita Lau islands
Founded during/after the dragon war, by a pair of dragons who mostly wanted to stay out of the whole thing, while still using the influence they had over their territory to protect the local humans.

Dragonhalls has grown extensively throughout the millenia, and now extends across several hundred kilomiters of mountain range, and hosts over a dozen dragons - 
the largest population of dragons in a single place anywhere in the world. The draconic inhabitants consist primarly of the two founders and their children's families. 
However, it has also collected a couple more eccentric dragons who prefer living among humans to the more traditional draconic lifestyle.
A few of these dragons will even deign to be ridden by humans on a regular basis, most often on hunting trips.

Dragonhalls is surrounded by extensive farmland on all sides, both in the surrounding valleys and lowlands, and in terraces up the edges of the mountains.

## Cuisine
It is home to particular unique cuisine, which incorporates quite a lot of megafauna - wurms, levaithans, krakens, etc. 
Harvesting wide-ranging aquatic megafauna is pretty much the only way for this many dragons in one place to be sustainable.

Draconic residents help with the actual hunt, and in turn benifit from somewhat more sophisticated food preparation than is typical for dragons.
Some dragons who don't reside in Dragonhalls sometimes visit just for the food.

## Art and Architecture

Large (15-20 m tall, similar width) pillared halls running the circumference of the mountain range, open to the air on one side.
Suitible for dragons to comfortably pass through (on foot), without crowding out human pedestrians.

Large balconies, making good landing zones.

Bas-releifs, etc.

Several particulalry spectactular public bathouses. 
Most include a section with depth suitable for a dragon (5-6m for bathing, 20m+ for swimming), and an equally large section more suited to Ael.
Geothermal heat source. At least one is in an open-air caldera, and is the largest by far. Some are indoors.

## Layout


In the current day, Dragonhalls spans a 300km long stretch of mountain range, running north-northwest along the larger of the eastern Kita Lau islands. 
Along this stretch, there are 7 inhabited dragon lairs.

1. The first of these was constructed by the founders, and is about 50km southeast of the midpoint of Dragonhalls. It is inhabited by their daughter Turi, the current leader of Dragonhalls, along with her parther and their children.
2. The second is at the far southeast end of Dragonhalls. It is quite isolated from the Ael-built areas of Dragonhalls and was constructed by Rahkaya. It is now inhabited by a reclusive dragon from Southern Xuon.
3. Rahkaya's current lair is 80 km north of the founders lair, and is much closer to the Ael-inhabited areas of the city.
4. Northwest of the founders lair, near the center of Dragonshalls. Originally the lair of Melias, until he left, then later the lair of Turi, until she returned to her parents lair after her mother's death. Currently used by Feathermail when she is in Dragonhalls.
5. Further northwest. Lair of Feathermail's father
6. Northenmost region of dragonhalls. Origionally the lair of <deceased F Western Dragon>. Now inhabited by <M Plains Dragon>
7. Westernmost section of dragonhalls. Lair of Carvedscale

A handfull of other lairs exist outside of central Dragonhalls, though only a couple are currently inhabited.

The vast majority of the aggriculture that feeds Dragonhalls occurs across four valleys - two on the northeast side of the mountain range, and two to the southwest of it.

Four major Ael population centers
1. The Old City, surrounding the founder's lair.
2. The Highland Crossroads, between lairs 1, 3, and 4, and serving as a sort of crossroads for the southeast section of dragonhalls. Its outskirts merge together with those of the Old City.
3. The Pass, in a lower section of the mountains, providing a path between the two northernmost valleys and access to the northwest and southeast sections of dragonhalls
4. Dragon's Gate, at the far northwest end of dragonhalls, both a crossroads for the whole northwest section and and a gateway between Dragonhalls and the rest of the Lauan island upon which it resides.

All of these locations are connected by a network of roofed roads inset into the sides of the mountain range, which are what Dragonhalls is named after.
While these roads are primarly used by the Ael citizens of Dragonhalls, they are all sized to accomadate a dragon - 50m wide, with a 30m ceiling.
They also feature regularly spaced open balconies, used as platforms for landing and takeoff.

Bathouses

Largest in a caldera. Particularly favored by dragons for its size.
One at midpoint between two moutains, fed by hotsprings. Hosts a mid-sized town, often used as an overnight rest stop for travelers going between the Old City, the Highland Crossroads, and the eastmost agricultural valley.
One mostly interior, but looking out to cliffside.

Mid-sized indoor bathouse in the public area of the founders lair. 

## History

Dragonhalls was founded in the later stages of the dragon war (5000 BC), by a pair of dragons who mostly wanted to stay out of the whole thing, 
while still using the influence they had over their territory to protect the local humans.

Initially, the two founders (and soon after, their first child) were the only dragons residing in Dragonhalls, but they were shortly joined by a couple other dragons from Xuon, 
who were unsatisfied with the emerging Xeres Empire. At first, the settlement was focused around the founders lair, a mountain peak in the central-southeast area of its modern-day extent. 
It has grown substantially since this time

It has maintained a sizeable population ever since. At any given time, between five and fifteen dragons have resided in Dragonhalls.

Dragonhalls remained independant during the time of the Xeres Empire, and maintained somewhat more equal relations between dragons and humans during that time.
As a consequence, it served as a haven for refugees from the empire during that time.

The two founders died fighting the Uon in 1500 BC and 90 BC, respectively. However, they were successful in preventing the Uon from establishing a foothold in Kita Lau, and later assisted in the later stages of the conflict in Eaos.
The current leader of Dragonhalls is the second child of the founders.

In modern times, Dragonhalls boasts the closest relations between dragons and humans anywhere in the world.
