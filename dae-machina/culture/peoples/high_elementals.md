# High Elementals

High elementals include all elementals that can be considered sapient.
Many large, ancient elementals eventually develop sapience, but are still usually governed by their fundamental natures, and as such don't really interact with Ael (except for the rare mage who tries to enforce their will upon the elemental).

In addition to these elementals, there are two types of elementals that are inherently sapient: 

## Gyldraed

Gyldraed are elementals of a location. They have human-level intelligence, and are devoted solely to the defense and wellbeing of their domain. 
Their “body”, technically encompasses the entirety of their domain, but they will commonly manifest an avatar within their domain, especially when interacting with others. 
When manifesting such an avatar, they will usually loosly mirror the form of whatever being they are interacting with, but formed from the substance of their domain.
If their domain is respected, they are not hostile, but if their domain is threatened in any way they will do everything within their considerable power to remove the threat. 
Gyldraed can manipulate anything that is part of their domain, reshaping and altering it at will. They can make trees and rocks move, and can exert a limited mental influence 
over any animals native to their domain. Gyldraed cannot speak, but can communicate mentally. They generally communicate in termes of concepts, feelings, and visions of present 
or potential events rather than using words.

Gyldraed may come into being in any natural region that has a fairly stable terrain (in other words, that hasn’t changed significantly over the last few millennia) and a reasonably high concentration of magic. 
Gyldraed will live for as long as their domain remains in existence. Gyldraed are relatively common.

Since they are bound to one location, many Gyldraed are necessarily solitary, with no connection to their kin. However, some share borders with others, 
for instance the Gyldraed of a forest that touches the edge of a great river, with its own Gyldraed. This usually results in a close bond between the two entities.
In cases where two Gyldraed of a similar nature grow to meet each other (most common in the case of two forests which eventually merge, althogh can happen with rivers and such as well), they will often (but not always)
merge into a single entity.

## Vyldarthe

Vyldarthe are similar to Gyldraed in intelligence and power, but are not linked to a domain and instead tend to wander across the land. They seem to crave new places and experiences, 
and rarely remain in one place for long. Like Gyldraed, they cannot speak, but are capable of communicating mentally. They are quite rare.

The form of a Vyldarthe is less mercurial than that of a Gyldraed, but shaped in similar fashionl; built up from aspects from other sapients they've interacted with.
Young vyldarthe extreemly varied, not relaly having settled down on anything appriaching a permanent form
Older vyldarth usually settle on some sort of humanoid shape, given that the Ael are the most common form of sapient life. Some, especially those formed in the domain of the deep fae, opt for a more animal-like form instead.
Some particularly ancient vyldarth settled on the form of a dragon several millenia ago, and aren't changing to become more Ael-compatible anytime soon.
