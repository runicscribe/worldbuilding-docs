# Dragons

Dragons look like large winged lizards. They have a long neck and even longer tail, four legs and and a pair of batlike wings. 
Their front legs can also serve as arms, and their back legs are digitigrade. Each of foot has three front toes ending in long talons, plus one opposable claw. Their wings have for finger struts, plus one semi-opposable claw.
They have a long mouth full of needle-like teeth. They have a narrow nose with side-mounted nostrils. Their eyes are large, slitted, and forward-facing. They have internal ears behind and below their eye level. Most dragons 
have a head surrounded with spines and horns, most prominant at the base of their jaw and behind their brows.
Their chest is quite deep, consisting primarily of wing muscles, with a much more narrow lower torso.
Most dragons also have spikes or ridges running down the length of their spine, from the base of their skull to the tip of their tail.

Female dragons are on average 20-25% larger than males.

Dragons are sapient, and tend to be quite intelligent. All dragons have a tendency towards hoarding, although individual dragons will hoard different things. Many dragons hoard gems, gold, or wealth, but others may hoard 
magical artifacts, art, or knowledge. Dragons have their own spoken language, but can often speak and write in a variety of human languages. Many dragons are philosophers and researchers, devoting a great deal of time to 
unraveling how some aspect of the universe works. There have also been a number of dragon warlords and conquerors who have taken over local human civilizations over the ages, although these have generally limited their 
conquests to within their own territories. Since dragons are solitary and have an extremely low population density, there is no real dragon civilization, although some dragons have contributed to the success of certain 
human civilizations. Younger dragons (50-500 years of age) tend to be more likely to interact directly with humans, for a variety of reasons (there are less arrogant/assured of their superiority at this age; 
they may not yet have the power/influence to carve out their own territory; they are physically smaller, such that they can be mostly comfortable among human architecture, etc.)

Because of their size and large appetite, dragons tend to be solitary, with territories ranging in size from 20,000 to 100,000 square kilometers (this is equivalent to a circular region with radius 80 to 180 kilometers). 
As a consequence, the global dragon population is around 1000 – 2000 dragons. Dragons will sometimes form agreements with the humans living in their area, usually something along the lines of the dragon not attacking 
their cities in return for a regular tribute of meat. Dragons usually eat large herd animals such as deer or sheep, although they may eat humans if given cause to. 

Dragons are extremely long-lived, with a natural lifespan of around 4000 - 6000 years. Due to their magical nature, most dragons learn to magically extend their life beyond their natural limits.
Because of this immense longevity, dragons reproduce rarely, only one or two dragons born every few centuries. The one exception is after especially cataclysmic events that actually manage to impact the dragon population -
in the wake of such events, there tend to be quite a few new dragons born. For this reason, there are quite a few dragons just over 5000 years old, (born just after the Dragon war), as well as a dozen or so born during or after the Uon war. 

## Reproduction and Development

Require specific nutirents (most comonnly found in members of the Cercis or Concha families) to be fertile. 
(Exact nutrients requireed are different between male and female dragons - serpentfish or certain aquatic mammals are also sufficent for males)

If these conditions are met, a female dragon will begin to ovulate (although never more that once in one year). 

Similar to certain reptiles, female dragons may store sperm internally for up to 3 months before releasing an egg for fertilization.

When an oocyte relized this way is fertilized, the other structures that make up the egg start to form around it, starting with the yolk, and ending with the shell.
This process takes about 3-6 (? months), after which the egg is laid. The embryo must develop for a futher 6-12 (?) months before the egg hatches.

Dragon eggs are relatively small compared to their body size, about 12 - 20 cm in diameter.

Newly hatched dragons are likewise quite small - about the side of a housecat. 
After hatching, they grow fairly rapidly for the first 100 years of their life, after which their growth slows down substantially, although it never quite stops. 
Phisical development occurs quickly - at 3-6 months they can run, glide short distances, and hunt small game.
Mental development is rather slower - for the first few years of their life, they operate mainly on instict. By 10 years, they have comparable intelligence to a young human child. 
This is also when they start being able to fly (rather than just glide). Dragons reach sexual maturity at about 30-40 years of age, and mental maturity at 50-60, 
although are still not truly considered an adult by other dragons until they reach 100. Upon reaching 1000 years, dragons are considered elders worthy of respect in the dragon community


All dragons naturally have access to an imense amount of magical power. Most dragons are also skilled sorcerers, and often use magic to appear to “breathe” elemental blasts like fire or ice. 
Their magical nature also assists in their ability to fly. Some dragons can shapeshift into a human(like) form. When they shapeshift, they typically retain their mass (with a corresponding increase in density), 
and much of their original strength, as well as all their magical abilities. Due to the complex nature of this transmutation, it takes rather more time (up to an hour) than conventional shapehifting.

Some dragons use their magical strength to petrify foes. These dragons are someties refered to as basilisks (or gorgons if they take human form).

## Culture and Language

Mostly solitary, and magically gifted enough that most dragons are capable of telepethy, little need for language among dragons.
Many early dragons invented their own mutually unintelligble languages for reasoning and keeping records.

After first dragon war, some started developing beginnings of a shared language.
Took a while (few millenia) to catch on, and even then, primarily used as formality during rare gatherings.

## Types of Dragons:

There is a great degree of variety in the apperances of individual dragons. Despite this, the Ael typically try to classify dragons into five types, based on common groups of characteristics.
These are not distinct species (all dragons are fertile with each other), and don't always follow from parent to child as one might expect - incidental mountain dragon genes from a couple of generations up the family tree 
(which, given the lifespan of dragons, could be thousands of years ago) might suddenly show up in the child of two plains dragons. Some dragons also show a mix of traits.

### Gold / Horned / Plains Dragon

Plains dragons are the largest type of dragon. They average 25-45m long and 5-9m at the shoulder, with a 1.7-3m long head.
Their head has a pair of large, slightly curved horns, prodruding from the back of their head, and their jawline is lined with a row of smaller spines.
They have long hind legs and broad, raptorlike talons.

Plains dragons are found in mountain and cliff regions near savannah and plains, where they hunt large mammals.  They are gold, bronze, or copper in color.


### Red / Plated / Mountain Dragon

Mountain dragons average 20-40 m long and 3.3-6.6m at the shoulder, with a 1-2m long head.
Their head narrows to a vertical ridge at the front and has a single, diamond-shaped armor plate on top.
They have a long neck and tail and a bulky torso and legs. 
Their hide is covered in large, interlocking armor plates, especially along the neck, spine, underbelly, and tail. The legs are covered in smaller scales, and the wings are broad and leathery. 
The tail of mountain dragons tends to be broad and has an enlarged/swolen tip.

Mountain dragons are generally some combination of red, orange, grey, or black in color, with a darker spine and lighter underbelly and wing membranes.
Mountain dragons prefer to live in steep, rocky mountains, caves, and volcanic regions. Compared to other dragons, mountain dragons are relatively poor fliers, but very good at tunnelling.


### Green / Western / Forest Dragon

Forest dragons are small (for a dragon), but have a long, serpentine body. They average 15-30 m long and 2.5-4.75m at the shoulder, with a 0.9-1.7m long head.
They usually have two pairs (four total) of antler-like horns on the back of their head, and a rounded snout. 
Forest dragons have a long wingspan, but relatively narrow wings. Their body is covered in small scales, with larger plates on their underbelly. They often have a feathery mane and tail.

Forest dragons tend to be brightly colors, and are usually green, red, blue and/or gold in color, often in a mottled pattern.
Forest dragons are primarily found in rainforest regions on the western continent and the Xhal isles. They generally hunt medium sized rainforest animals (deer, pigs, monkeys) and will also catch fish. 
Like tundra dragons, they are capable swimmers.

### Blue / Spined / Valley Dragon

Valley dragons are on the smaller side; 10-28m long and 2-6m at the shoulder, with a 0.7-2m long head. 
Their head is framed by three or more pairs of curved similarily sized horns, and their tail ends in a curved blade.

Valley dragons are puple, blue, black, or silver in color. They prefer jungle and forest regions, although they can also be found in cliffs and canyons, often with a brown or tan coloration. 
They are equaly comfortable moving in the sky or on the ground, where they move with a feline grace.

### White / Finned / Tundra Dragon

Tundra dragons are similar in size and appearance to spined dragons, but stouter, bulkier, and with shorter, straighter spines and horns. They average 10-25m long and 2.6-6.3m at the shoulder, with a 0.7-1.75m long head.
Like spined dragons, they have three or more pairs of horns framing their head, but their horns are straight, flat, and broad.
Tundra dragons have paired spines running the length of their body, which become in a pair of horizontal, webbed fins at the end of their tail.

Tundra dragons are white, blue, or grey in color. They frequent arctic and tundra regions, as well as remote, rocky islands. They hunt elk, reindeer and occasionally aquatic mammals.
