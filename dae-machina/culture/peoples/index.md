# Peoples

All across Dael can be found a variety of sapient entities, both magical and mundane.

## Ældar

The Ældar were a species of magically gifted humanoids who originated about 200,000 years ago in central Eaos. lived between 100,000 and 10,000 BC.
Ældar resembled stocky, swarthy humans with brown or black hair and eyes. The Ældar civilization rose to prominence on the southwestern continent around 50,000 BC, and gradually spread across most of the known world. 
The Ældar civilization was primarily agricultural, and relied one stone or bronze tools. However, many advanced feats of engineering were accomplished through magical means. 
Between 10,000 BC and 3,000 BC, the Ældar civilization gradually spread across Dael, creating the modern Æl lineages. These are:

- [Æl'daal](./aeldar/aeldaal): Eastern humans, spread all accross the continent of Eaos.
- [Æl'fae](./aeldar/aelfae): Nomadic natural shapeshifters
- [Æl'jinn](./aeldar/aeljinn): Elemental shapeshifters, who live in great cities far to the southeast
- [Æl'mið](./aeldar/aelmidh): Northern miners, smiths, enchanters.
- [Æl'thal](./aeldar/aelthal): The western empire, across the sea.
- [Æl'xhal](./aeldar/aelxhal): Islanders who live between the 'thal and the 'daal. Used to be part of a great Empire, before the rise of the Uon and the Cataclysm

The Æl prefix is usually dropped when refering to a single group, so the Æl'daal are commonly called the 'daal.
Coloquially, the Æl'daal, Æl'mið, Æl'thal and Æl'xhal are collectively called the Æl, whereas Ældar is used to refer to all six lineages.
The wide variety of Æl'fae makes them a bit of a special case, and they are often grouped by the Æl that they are most similar to; so the nomadic 'fae tribes found across Eaos are called the Daal'fae.
The 'jinn have their own set of prefixes and suffixes related to elemental affinity, but most Æl just call them all 'jinn.

## [Uon](./uon)

The Uon diverged from the same common ancestor Ældar about 100,000 years ago. Early in their evolution, the Uon developed potent telepathic abilities that eventually defined their culture and appearance. 
Approximately 50,000 years ago, the Uon had developed a collective consciousness spanning their entire species, and the Uon physiology had become substantially different than that of the Ældar. 
Around 2000 BC, the rapidly growing civilizations of the Uon and the Æl'daal came into contact with one another. Conflict between the Uon and the Æl'daal continued over the next 2000 years, 
with the Uon gradually gaining territory on the western continent. 

The Uon civilization was completely wiped duringout when an attempt to create an artificial god failed. 
This caused a magical overload across the Uon species, and threw the magical energies of the region into chaos, creating the [riftscape](../../world/geography/index.html#riftscape). 

## [Dragons](./dragons)

Dragons look like large winged lizards. They have a long neck and tail, four legs with opposable claws on each foot, and a pair of batlike wings. Most dragons are skilled sorcerers, 
and often use magic to appear to 'breathe' elemental blasts like fire or ice. They are extremely long-lived, with average lifespan of about 4000 years, and tend to be quite intelligent. 
All dragons have a tendency towards hoarding, although individual dragons will hoard different things. Many dragons hoard gems, gold, or wealth, but others may hoard magical artifacts, art, or knowledge. 

Because of their size and large appetite, dragons tend to be solitary, with territories ranging in size from 20,000 to 100,000 square kilometers (this is equivalent to a circular region with radius 80 to 180 kilometers). 
As a consequence, the global dragon population is around 1000 - 3000 dragons. 

Dragons will sometimes form agreements with the humans living in their area, usually something along the lines of the dragon not attacking their cities in return for a regular tribute of meat. 
Dragons usually eat large herd animals such as deer or sheep, although they may eat humans if given cause to. Dragons have their own spoken language, but can often speak and write in a variety of human languages as well. 
Additionally, most dragons are skilled in telepathy.

Many dragons are philosophers and researchers, devoting a great deal of time to unraveling how some aspect of the universe works. 
There have also been a number of dragon warlords and conquerors who have taken over local human civilizations over the ages, although these have generally limited their conquests to within their own territories. 
Since dragons are solitary and have an extremely low population density, there is no real dragon civilization, although some dragons have contributed to the success of certain human civilizations.

## [High Elementals](./high_elementals)

High elementals refer to any elementals that can be considered sentient.
