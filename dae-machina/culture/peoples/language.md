# Language

The various languages of Dael can be organized into eleven loose groups.

- **Draconic**: The oldest language family, but also one of the smallest, comprising the written and spoken languages of Dragonkind.
- **Uon**: Includes the various written languages of the Uon. Does not have any spoken form.
- **Daelean**: Rooted in Old Aeldar, and includes most languages spoken by the Ael'daal, Ael'midh, and Eaosian 'jinn.
- **Lauan**: The oldest of the three language families found across the Kita Lau isles
- **Eaos-Fae**: Includes all Daal'fae and Midh'fae cants, along with spoken Leonin (although some scholars consider this the sole member of its own language family)
- **Nortusk**: Comprises the languages spoken by the Dhagian 'midh and Northern 'thal
- **Quontuk**: Includes the offical language of the Quon Xi empire, along with several other languages spoken across eastern Quon Xi and western Kita Lau
- **Kaldean**: Includes a wide variety of languages spoken throughout western and southern Quon Xi.
- **Draco-Xerec**: Originated with the Xeres empire, and now found in several different languages.
- **Sache-Fae**: Includes the spoken languages of the Xhal'fae, Xhao'fae, and Merfae, as well as with Sache sign.
- **Tonal 'jinn**: The youngest language family, including only the Tonal 'jinn language.


## Contemporary Languages

### Daelean Languages

The Daelean languages are spoken by a variety of peoples across Eaos-Mhidda.

They are subdivided into four groups: 
- **Futhern**: Futhern Dal and Drakkar languages. Runic Phonetic Script
- **Central Eaosian**: Elyos, Free Cities, and Riftlander languages. Phonetic script.
- **Aelmon**: This group contains only a single living language, that of the Ael'jinn. The spoken form of this language is very similar to the Old Aeldar language that was spoken in Aelmos. It also uses the same script. 
- **Sacheal**: Shared language of the Sach’ean. Relatively close to old Aeldar, but also incorporates quite a bit of vocabulary originating from the Sache

### Eaos-Fae languages

The Eaosian 'fae have their own unique set of languages, similar to both conventional animal communication and human language and tailored towards communication between two forms. 
Different tribes use different dialects, but the language structure tends to be quite similar.

Primary constituents:
- **Vocalizations**. Æl'fae use a fairly simple proto-language that can be spoken in either form. It is used primarily for quick commands or queries, and long distance communications. It is not a complete language, 
  and is insufficient for comunicationg more complex concepts.
- **Body Language**. Much of the more subtle communication between 'fae occurs through body language. This body language is fairly similar to that of the respective base forms, 
  so they are also farly good at picking up cues from regular humans and animals.
- **Symbols**. Most 'fae also use a fairly basic collection of symbols for marking territory and other locations of value. These symbols are intended to be producible in both human and animal form, 
  usually by scratching/carving them into wood or stone. Given the diversity of predatory fae among the Plains 'fae, many plains tribes wear a woven armband indicating their tribe, 
  intended to differentiate them from regular animals to predatory fae or human hunters.

Æl'fae rely on scent based communication much less than regular animals. While 'fae in human-form have a better sense of smell, it is still far inferior to most animals. 
Consequently, while they will take advantage of smell while in their animal form, they do not rely on it much for communication.

The various Eaos-Mhidda fae languages have a shared root, and are somewhat similar to each other. A couple show significant differences:
- The hyena 'fae language incorporates a lot of vocalizations, and is almost entirely unpronuncable by non-hyenids.
- The leonine Daal'fae mostly stick to a human form, and have a unique spoken language.

Many Æl'fae are also able speak the common tongue of their region while in human form.

Given its fairly complex nature, very few non-fae are capable of speaking 'fae dialects.

### Sache-Fae languages

The three types of xhal'fae (feline, xhao'fae, merfae) all have a single hybrid form, and as a consequence their languages have a more conventional vocal form than the Eaos-Fae languages.
They have some overlap with Lauan and Draco-Xerec language families, but still comprise a distinct language family.

#### Abyssal

The language spoken by the Abyssal Merfae of Chasmlight is quite distinct from other Sache-Fae languages, and incorporates bioluminescent signaling a along with vocal componants

#### Sache Sign

The Sache-fae language group also includes a sophisticated sign language used by many Merfae.
Feline Xhal'fae sometimes use a simpler version of this.

### Draco-Xerec Languages

Originated with the language of the Xeres empire. Blends aspects of the Draconic languages with the Lauan languages.
Has a symbolic script that is very similar script to written Draconic.

Languages in this group are spoken by the Xeres Remnant, Xencha Defiant, Dragonhalls, and remaining followers of the Xeres Orthodoxy.  

### Lauan

Lauan is the oldest of the three language families found across the Kita Lau isles.
Modern speakers are mostly found among the central Kita-Lau isles

### Nortusk
Nortusk is an ancient language family originating from before the Dragon war. It shares some roots with Futhern, Quontuk, and, to a lesser extend, Kaldean, but is quite distinct from all three.
Two major branches of this language family exist in the modern day - one spoken by the 'mihd tribes in the northwest region of the Dhagian Isles, and one spoken by the  nomadic people of northeast Quon Xi. Both branches have numberous dialects.

### Quontuk Languages

Includes the official language of the Quon Xi Empire, spoken mainly in the Heartland regions, and several central valley languages.
These languages all use a shared symbolic script.



### Kaldean

Kaldean includes a wide variety of languages spoken throughout western and southern Quon Xi.
In the southern valley regions, many Kaldean dialects have blended heavily with Quontuk.

Some of the northwestern people of Quon Xi speak a distant dialect of this language, that is largely unintelligble to speakes from the west coast.

### Tonal 'jinn language

Developed by full elemental-form 'jinn around 2,200 BC.
Constructed from a mix of sonic and arcane resonances.
Mainly used by 'jinn when in full elemental form, although is the primary language of the aquatic 'jinn cities.

Extremely difficult for non-'jinn to speak, and almost as hard to understand, but some mages have managed to do both.

## Sign Languages

### Blackport Sign 
Rooted in basic hand-signlas used by sailors, and brought to the free cities underworld by pirates as a means of clandestine communication.
During this process, many signs were added, gradully growning into a complete language, even if it still has a relatively small lexicon.
Blackport sign is still used primarly by the Free cities underworld, but also by sailors, dockworkers, and urban 'fae. 

### Eastern Mage Sign
Originated in Old Aelmos, as a standard sign language.
Mostly lost/fell out of use during the chaos of the lich wars, except by a small handfull of mages who incidently used it as a somatic aid to spellcasting.
These mages inadvertantly taught it to their respective apprentices, and it has survived in this way to the modern day, where it is mostly used in occult circles.

The main sign language of the 'jinn has the same root, althogh is rather more intact.

Both technically fall under the Aelmon subgroup of the Daelean language family.

### Elyos military signals

Used by the Elyos military. Not a full sign language, although a variant used by the Riftlanders is starting to grow into one.
Collaboration between nations during Uon wars caused this to adopt symbology from a bunch of differnt peoples, so this riftlander variant is starting to become sign-language equivalent of a trade languange.

### Plains Sign
Signed representation of Elyos language, used mostly by deaf people across Eaos.

### Crescent Fae Sign

Fae sign language incorporating a mix of hand and ear signals.
Still simpler than fae cants. Used as a common language in the Shapeshifter commune and Crescent Route caravan.
Has also picked up some use among different fae caravans as a trade language.

Use of ear signals means its not really usable by Ael.

## Draconic

The draconic language exists in both spoken and written forms, though the spoken form is used only rarely, as most dragons communicate through telepathy.

## Ancient Draconic Script

The first shared draconic language rose in the aftermath of the first dragon war.
Prior to this, some dragons did invent their own mutually unintelligble languages for reasoning and keeping records. This practice has continued into the modern era, though invented languages are now mostly used only by the more secritive or eccentric dragons. 
This shared language took a while (a few millenia) to catch on, and even then, was primarily used as a formality during rare gatherings. Both spoken and writen draconic has evolved significantly in the many million years since it was developed. 
Through the draconic accords, knowledge of this original written form has been preserved, but many intermediate forms have been lost to time.
It is not known if Ancient Dragonic ever had a spoken form - if so, it has not survived into the modern form.

The script itself is comprised of runes that are easily carved using claws.

## Contemporary Draconic Script

The contemporary draconic script has been in use for the past hundred-thousand years or so. It has a rather more abstract appereance than Ancient Draconic, and many more symbols.
It is similar to the Draco-Xerec script, but still visibly and structurally different. 

## Spoken Draconic

Spoken draconic infrequently used, and not all dragons know it. It is most often used as a courtesy in places where three or more dragons live in one place.
There are several regional dialects of spoken Draconic.
