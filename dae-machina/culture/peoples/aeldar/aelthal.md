# Æl'thal

The Æl'thal are the primary inhabitants of the western continent, Quon Xi. They are descended from an offshoot of the early Æl'midh that colonized the eastern continent about 20,000 years ago. The
Æl'thal have a different physical appearance and language than the Æl'midh, but are physiologically quite similar.
Pureblooded Æl'thal have pale to olive skin. Æl'thal from the eastern regions of Quon Xi often have some Æl'xhal ancestry and tend to have darker skin.
All Æl'thal have straigh hair, blond, platinum-blond, or silver in color. Their eye colors range from amber to green to blue to (very rarely) purple.
Æl'thal have slanted eyes and small but distinctive noses.


Æl'thal have natural magical talents towards kinesis, elementalism, and all etherial schools of magic.

There are three broad cultural groups of Ael'thal.
 - The Æl'thal of the central and eastern reaches of the continent belong to the Empire of the Rising Sun. It is a hiearchical bueracracy, with rank primarily based on merit. The empire has a large, strictly organized military, with a strong mage component.
 - The northen reaches of the continent are sparsely populated, and home to a variety of small tribes. Of all the Ael'thal, these are most similar to the Ael'midh.
 - The Ael'thal of western Quon Xi are not part the Empire and have their own distinct culture. The region consists of a variety of independant states, who have established an uneasy alliance so that they remain seperate from the Empire.
