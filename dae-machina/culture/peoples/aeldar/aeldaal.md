# Æl'daal 

The Æl'daal are the closest descendants of the ancient Ældar civilization, and now inhabit much of the known world.
They can be found throughout Eaos, many of the neighboring regions.
They are olive to dark skinned with black or brown (curly) hair. They have green or brown eyes.

The Æl'daal have no natural magical abilities, but have a natural talent for magic in all its forms. They do tend to lean slightly towards physical magic and sympathy.

The [Elyos Republic](../../organizations/elyos_republic) (which formed from a collection of losely allied contries during the Uon war) hosts the largest population of Æl'daal, but there are several other notable Daal countries. 
The [Free Cities](../../organizations/free_cities) is a series of independant city-states to the southeast of the Republic. The Republic and the Free Cities have a high level of technology and great deal of knowledge of the workings of magic and the physical world.
The Enhat-Tehktun are further south, and formed from the remenants of a couple Xhal and Daal countries that were destroyed during the Uon Cataclysm
The [Sach’ean Daal](../../organizations/sachean_isles) are an ancient island nation, roughtly equal parts Ael'daal and Merfae.
The [Riftlander nation](./riftlanders) is on the coast between the Free Cities and the Enhat-Tehktun. While its citizens come from many nationalities, the majority are Daal.
