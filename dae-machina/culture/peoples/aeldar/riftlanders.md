# Riftlanders

Riftlanders refer to the people residing in western Eaos, on the edge of the riftscape. 
They are not realy a distinct lineage in the same way as the Ael'daal, 'midh, or 'thal, but rather retired soldiers and camp followers (and their descendants) from the Uon war. 
Most riftlanders are mixed-blood daal / midh / jinn, though there are also a handful of 'xhal. They tend towards medium skin tones and medium to dark hair.
