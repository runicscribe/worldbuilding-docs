# Æl'fae

The original Æl'fae were a group of Ældar skilled in animal shapeshifting, who left the Ældar civilization to live more in-tune with nature.
Modern Æl'fae are nomadic [natural shapeshifters](../../../world/magic/disciplines/shapeshifting), who can shapeshift between a human form and a single animal form. 
Æl'fae most often live in small family groups (5-15 individuals), much like the beasts they embody. A single family of 'fae will generally have the same or similar animal form.
Larger groups also exist, but only where resources are particularly plentiful, as the 'fae generally subsist on a hunter-gatherer lifstyle. Lone 'fae are also somewhat common, especially among the Xhal'fae.

Æl'fae have an average lifespan of 35-50 years. They reach physical maturity at age 9-10 if born in human form, or age 3-4 if born in animal form. They reach their adult size at around age 12 - 16 (regardless of birth form). 
Æl'fae usually manifest their shapeshifting abilities shortly before they reach physical maturity. All types of Æl'fae tend to adopt many of the mannerisms and behaviors of the animal forms they favor. 
Æl'fae do not have a shared spoken language. Instead, they communicate using a complex combination of vocalizations and body language similar to that used by the forms they favor 
(with some modifications for expressing more complex concepts). This allows for communication between 'fae who are in animal forms, 'fae in human forms, and direbeasts ('fae who were born in animal form and are unable to shapeshift). 
Different groups of 'fae can usually understand each other reasonably well if their animal forms are similar. Fae who often interact with other disparate groups generally learn their language as well. 
Many 'fae tribes can also speak the common human language(s) of the region they inhabit, especially if they regularily interact with humans.
Like all Eldar, most High fae can speak a wide range of languages.

The Æl'fae's shapshifting abilities has some unusual effects uppon their body, which are mediatied by the magic involved.
They are capable of healing from most injuries while shifting forms, but scars and amputations will persist between forms.
Natural cycles like menses or heat will generally match what is normal for the form an individual is in, although there can be some bleed-over.
Pregnacy inhibits the ability to shapeshift. Æl'fae who become pregnant in animal form will generally produce produce smaller litters than in natural animals. 

Æl'fae social practices are usually loosly modeled on those of the animal form they favor. Various groups will also have their own unique cultural affects, like any other group of people.
The specific subspecies represented by the animal forms of the varuios 'fae tribes generally do not exist as mundane animals. Many of them did exist at one time, but were outcompeted by their 'fae counterpart, 
or interbred with the fae so as to become indistinguishable. In either case, direbeasts were the primary driver for this dissaperance.
Mundane and magical animals that are rather similar do exist. They are typically adapted to a slighly different ecological niche, or have some unique ability which puts them on a more even footing with the local 'fae.

There are three main 'fae bloodlines, each originating from a different group of Ældar, along with a handful of offsoots:

## Plains Tribes (Daal'fae)

The Daal'fae are the oldest of the 'fae bloodlines, originating from the first Æl'daal Empire. They are the most varied of the three bloodlines, and inhabit the savannah and jungle regions of central Eaos. 

The Daal'fae organize themselves into different tribes, based on their animal form. These tribes include Red Wolf, Wild Dog, Hyena, Antelope, Gazelle, Goat, Deer, Elk, and Lion. 
Many of these groups are nomadic, especially the cervid tribes. Most Daal'fae tribes are matriarchal, and have a somewhat dynamic membership, shifting from year to year.

Daal'fae usually retain a humanoid form, which is similar in appearance to the ÆL'daal, but retain a number of animal characteristics including antlers, elongated ears, animal-like feet and legs, eyes, and skin patterns. 
Some of the predatory tribes - in particualar the Hyena and Red Wolf tribes - may have more animalistic facial features, while retaining a humanoid build.  

Most Daal'fae wear some sort of adornment that works for both humanoid and animal forms, like a beaded armband, a set of piercings, or horn jewelry. This is intended to allow other 'fae tribes to more easily 
differentiate animal-form 'fae from mundane animals, and acts as the underpinning of various truces between the predatory and prey-shaped 'fae.

Direbeasts (usually family members of the tribe) of this animal also tend to follow the tribe. Daal'fae tribes tend to be about three-quarters natural shapeshifters, and one-fifth direbeasts, 
with the remainder being 'fae in their humanoid form, that lack the ability to shapeshift.

Daal'fae are found across Eaos and Southern Mhidda.

### Cervid Tribes - Deer, Gazelle, Antelope, etc.

All of the cervid Daal'fae have fairly similar humanoid forms, which include: a humanlike upper body and face; cervid lower legs, tail, and ears; and horns or antlers.
Their lower legs have an animal-like amount of fur, while thinner fur covers the rest of their body, with the same (but fainter) pattern as their animal form. 
Some individuals may retain a fully deerlike head in human form; this is most common among 'fae who were born in animal form, but is still rather unusual.

Beaded armbands are commonly worn among the more deerlike cervid tribes. Many antelope tribes, with permanent horns, often use strings of beads strung between their horns instead.
In either case, these decorations have unique patterns based on tribe, with new patterns added when an individual moves between tribes, or when new tribes are formed.

Cervid tribes are nomadic groups which subsist through foraging. They tend towars a fairly consistent route, and will cultivate wild plants along this route, for better harvests the next time they come around.
These groups can vary quite a bit in size - most are between 10 - 40 individuals and consist of a single extended family, but there are quite a few substantiually larger groups.

Cervid 'fae tribes have a matriarchal social structure. Normal-sized groups are led by the oldest female. Her daughters and grandaughters typically remain with the group through their lives. 
Conversely, the male members of the group change fairly often. Male children normally leave to seek out another tribe once they are full grown, in order to find partners, and new males join the group in the same way
When the matriarch of a tribe dies, it fractures into seperate groups, each headed by one of her daughters.

Solitary males, or small groups of young males looking for a group to join are somewhat common.

Larger groups have a somewhat more complex social structure, acting more or less like a bunch of smaller groups merged together. These groups are still mostly extended family, that just stuck together even after their
matriarch died. Some have also absorbed other groups. Regardless of their composition, these groups have many different matriarchs, who comprise a council to handle larger decisions.

Regardless of group size, cervid 'fae have a very flexible stance towards relationships. Polygamous relationships are common. 
Short rendezvouz are seen as normal, even for 'fae in a long-term relationship - such engagements are especially common when two tribes encounter each other.

While nomadic, cervid 'fae often carry a fair number possessions, namely medicines, tents, and similar supplies. 
These is usually carried in saddlebags on the back of animal-form 'fae, or backpacks for human form 'fae. 
Most of the tribes inhabiting the plains of Central Eoas also maintain covered wagons, pulled by animal-form fae and direbeasts. Some of the northern Reindeer tribes instead use sleds and sleighs. 
Tools, clothing tents, and wagons are primarly crafted from various forms of plant matter – cedar, cotton, flax, bamboo, etc. 
A number of tribes trade with human settlements, exchanging food and spices for glasswork, metal wagon fittings, and other utilities they can't make themselves.

Cervid 'fae take their animal form for scouting purposes, and to pull sleds or wagons.

The various cervid tribes make up the majority of Daal'fae, and are found across Eaos and Mhidda. Known tribes include:
 - Deer tribes, mostly found across northern and central Eaos.
 - Goats, primarly found along the base of the Dragonspine Mountains.
 - Reindeer, mostly located in Mhidda and northeast Eaos. Physically the largest of the cervid 'fae, up to 300 lbs (7' tall in humanod form, not counting antlers).
 - A wide variety of antelope tribes, found across central and southern Eaos.
 
Magic among the cervid tribes is mosly limited to basic herbalism and healing magic, with a scattering of minor illusion and telepathy talents. 

### Lion Tribes

Among all the Daal'fae, the Lion Tribes have the fewest animal features in their humanoid form.
Their body appears entirely human, apart from a lion tail and claw-like nails. They have a human face, with a broad, blunt nose, leonine eyes, and ears that are halfway between human and lion.
While they have quite dark skin like most southern 'daal, their entire body is covered in short, light-colored fur, which gives them them a paler complexion than most other daal'fae.  
Male lion 'fae have a lion-like mane, while female lion 'fae have the same short fur on their head as on the rest of their body, giving them the appearance of baldness.

Like the cervid 'fae, the lion tribes are matriarchal. However, they are not nomadic, instead keeping to an established territory. This area will include some form of permanent settlement, 
such as a fortified cave or network of treehouses. Large portions of the tribe may leave on hunting expeditions for long periods of time - up to two weeks. 
Depending on the availability of prey, such expeditions may range beyond the tribe's claimed territory. 

The lion tribes are insular and xenophobic. They have a standing truce with the other Daal'fae tribes, and will occasionally trade with Daal'fae caravans, exchanging shelter, and safe passage, and worked goods 
for fabrics, plant dyes, and metal that the caravans obtained from human cities. Apart from this, they do not interact with other peoples, and are only group of Daal'fae who will readily kill and eat non-'fae Ael, 
making travel through lion 'fae territory exceptionally dangerous. Lion 'fae are found only in Eaos, in the savanah region between the Free Cities and the Great Desert.

There are not especially many Lion tribes, so defining what makes a normal group composition is difficult.
The most stable groups are large tribes, each of which consist of between 100 and 1000 individuals and comprise the the majority of the lion 'fae population. There are usually less than half a dozen such groups at any one time.
In adition to these, there are many smaller, single family tribes of one or two dozen individuals, as well as small wandering with no fixed territory. Both of these kinds of groups tend to be quite fragile, 
and are regularly absorbed, driven off, or killed by larger tribes. They are also most vulnerable to starvation in times of scarcity.
The wandering groups are typically formed from the remnants of tribes who were driven from their territory.

All lion tribes have a single leader. For the small groups that consist of a single extended family, this is the oldest female, and parent to the rest of the tribe.
For large tribes, the leader is selected from among the elder members. Traditionally, this is done through a trial by combat, with any female member who has at least one descendant living in the tribe eligible for the position. 
In practice, there are a lot more politics involved, with quite a bit of intimidation and sabotage happening behind the scenes whenever it is time to choose a new leader. 
As a consequence, the tribe leader will have fairly broad support among its members, restricting the candidate pool and making leadership challenges rare.
The less structured wandering groups also choose their leadership through combat, although there are less politics involved, and eligibility for the position is a bit more open ended. 
This makes leadership challenges relitively more common, and contributes to the fragility of such groups. 

As with the cervid 'fae, the female membership of lion 'fae tribes is fairly constant. Among the smaller lion tribes, male members leave when reaching adulthood ti join another tribe or wandering group. 
For larger tribes, males may remain and seek mates among an unrelated clique within the tribe, or leave and try and join another group.

Relationship dynamics are a bit more rigid among the lion 'fae, but polygamy is still accepted. The leader of a tribe will typically take her pick of males within the tribe, often establishing a harem. 
Other females will usually form a long-term relationship with a single partner.


Lion 'fae default to their humaniod form. They take animal form only rarely, for specific purposes. These include:
 - Ritual combat, including leadership challenges, as well as settling smaller disputes.
 - Courtship displays, which often involve some form of pursuit. However, sex is almost solely performed in human form.
 - Driving prey. The actual catching and killing is mostly done in human form though a mixture of traps and endurance hunting.

This somewhat ritualized use of shapeshifting means that members incapable of changing their form cannot lead a tribe, and may be treated as inferior and unsuitable mates. 
They may still achieve high social status, in part because they are not considered to be a threat.

Lion 'fae tribes are about four-fifths natural shapeshifters, and one-sixth non-shapeshifter humanoids, with the remainder made up of direbeasts.


The larger lion tribes have a fairly notable level of technology, despite still being primarly hunter-gatherers. 
The smaller tribes have much of the same skills and knowledge, but often lack sufficient infrastructure for some of the more complex work involved.

They make use of spears, bows, and knives for hunting and combat. Bows may be made from laminate horn or wood, and are strung with gut. Arrows and spears may be tipped with fire-hardened wood, bone, flint, or obsidian. 
Knives are usually knapped flint. Many tribes also have a small number of steel knives and spearheads obtained from trade with Daal'fae caravans.

Hunting techniques vary - larger heard animals may be harvested through game drive techniques, persistence hunting, or ambush.
Trapping, bowhunting, and falconry is used for hunting smaller game. Lion fae almost solely eat meat, utilizing plant products only for medicine and as recreational drugs.

Lion 'fae wear very little when on a hunt, often just a leather loincloth and a weapon-belt. However, they often have quite ornate outfits to wear within their dens, especially on formal occasions. 
These may be comprised of hides, furs, dyed cotton (obtained through trade), feathers, and jewelry made from some combination of bone, glass, copper, gold, and various semiprecios stones.
In addiont to this, some lion 'fae decorate their bodies with piercings, scarification, and intricate patterns shaved into their fur, exposing the dark skin beneath 
(this last one is usualy reserved for special occations, as it doesn't last very long).


The lion 'fae also have many skilled potters and glassblowers among their numbers. Aside from goods obtained through trade, metalwork is rare, but not unheard of. 
It is mostly limited, limited to workings of gold, and copper from easily-accessible surface sources and (rarely) panning.

Their lairs may include fairly sophisticated stonework and staturary when situated in rocky regions, or equally advanced woodwork for the more arboreal encampments.

The lion 'fae also have a complex spoken language that is only usable in their human form, in addtion to the more standard animal-form-compatible 'fae communication. 
Given their insular nature, there are few outside the lion tribes who speak this language.

They also have a heiroglyphic form of writing, used mostly for inscriptions on artwork, and for recording history.

Magecraft is seen as a worthy occupation among the lion tribes, and the larger tribes include a small number of quite talented mages, most commonly specializing in some combination of weather-magic, divination, and necromancy.

### Hyena Clans

The hyenid tribes have the most animalistic in appearance of all the daal'fae when in their humanoid form, looking more or less like a hyena walking on its hind legs, albiet with slightly more humanoid proportions.
They have long arms, short legs, a long torso, and a slightly hunched posture. They can comfortably run on all four limbs in their humanoid form, but are still capable of shifting to a full hyena form.

Hyena clans are quite consistently sized, and are almost always comprised of between thirty and one hundred indiviudals. They are matriarchal, and very hierarchical.
The core or the group is the matriarch and her immediate adult blood relations. Next in the hierarchy are any unrelated female adults, followed by the matriarch's mate, and then any adult males.
Children are at the bottom of the hierarchy. As with other Daal'fae, males typically leave upon reaching adulthood to join another clan. Hyena 'fae are often monogamous, but this can vary from clan to clan.

Hyena Clans are semi-nomadic, often constructing temporary dwellings that they use for a few months to a few years, before moving onto a new location 
(usually due to environmental concerns, such as better hunting, less competition, etc.). Hyena dwellings are constructed from hides, clay, packed earth, and/or wattle and daub, 
and consist of a network of interconnected rooms, trenches, and tunnels, generally below ground level. Some rooms are still open to air, acting like courtyards.
When moving sites, Hyena clans will take very little with them, instead collecting what they need when they arive at their destination. They will often reuse old hyenid dwellings if they find one in their a new location.

Clans subsist through hunting, scavenging, and gathering. The Hyena clans are found over a similar range to the lion tribes, although extending further north and west, into the more temeperate regions near the Free cities.
They make little use of weapons, relying mostly on their powerful jaws when hunting, but will construct pit traps, sinkholes, and hobbles which they drive prey towards. They also set more passive traps, such as snares.  
While hyenid 'fae will not hunt other sapient peoples, they put great importance on not wasting anything, and they have no issue scavenging the corpse of someone who is already dead. Certain clans also practice a form of ritualized cannabalism.

Some hyena 'fae practice magic, most often focusing on earth-shaping, psychometry, and/or necromancy. 
Hyena Necromancers tend to be just as good at quieting the undead as raising them, and may temporarily raise fresh carcasses as a way of more easily transporting their meat.

High rate of birth by caeserian section. Tend to be very good at it. Large number of Hyena 'fae that do live among other Aeldar are employed as midwives.

The hyena 'fae language incorporates a lot of vocalizations, and is almost entirely unpronuncable by non-hyenids. Hyena 'fae are also incapable of making many of the sounds necessary to speak other Ael languages.
This, coupled with their rather bestial appearance, means they pretty consistantly avoid human settlements, and even other 'fae. They sometimes interact with the Canid tribes, who can communicate somewhat well with them, 
and certain Daal'fae caravans.

Hyena 'fae do not wear clothing, finding their fur and thick hide plenty sufficient for protection, but will adorn themselves with piercings and jewelry, mostly made from bone, and occasionally scarification.
Like the deer 'fae, they will wear beaded armbands with clan-specific patterns, although the beadwork is mostly of bone and horn rather than glass and stone.   

### Canid Tribes - Wild Dogs and Red Wolves

Similar to the hyena clans, the humanoid form of the canid 'fae resembles a dog or wolf walking on its hind legs.  
They have digitigrade legs, a tail, and an animal-like head, and are covered entirely in fur. Their arms and hands have a more human-like shape, and are quite dextrous.
There overal proportions are also more human-like, and unlike the hyenid 'fae, cannot readily run on four legs while in human form, instead needing to switch to their animal form to do so.

Traditional canid bands consist of a single family unit, made up of a single pair and their juvenile offspring, resulting in group sizes of two to eight individuals.
They are semi-nomadic, and will typically stay in any given area for one to three weeks before moving on. They subsist on a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, eating small to medium-sized game, 
supplemented by gathering semi-wild fruits, vegetables, and nuts. When travelling, they eat a lot of premade trail rations like jerky and pemmican. Unlike most other Daal'fae tribes, Canids are exclusively monogamous. 

These small bands sometimes travel together with other canid 'fae for prolonged periods. Such meetings are often an oportunity for young adult members of the group to find a mate and form their own group, but are ultimately temporary.
The handful of more permanent large canid groups (including the [Eastern Valley Circut caravan](../../culture/organizations/daalfae_caravans)) that exist tend to have a very dynamic membership, 
and ultimately still consist primarly of small family that have merely come together temporarily, along with young adults looking for a partner. 
These groups retain a fairly consistent core set of members who lead and organize the group, and stops it from dissolving completely.

Canid bands are usually on good terms with the local daal'fae caravans, and often welcome at their great gatherings.

Canid 'fae are social and adventurous, and often eschew the traditional family clan dynamic, instead joining a Daal'fae caravan or living in an Ael settlement.
Some take a halfway approach, sticking to the traditional family group and nomadic lifestyle, but making a living through some humanlike occupation, like running a barge between the free cities.

Like the hyena 'fae, the canid tribes muzzle shape makes them incapable of speaking most Ael languages. 
The canid 'fae body language is better understood by other 'fae tribes than the hyenid language, so this isn't much of an issue among the Daal'fae caravans or the shifter commune in southwest Eaos, 
but it does make relations with the Ael'daal a bit more challenging. Despite these limitations, the canid tribes are enthusiastic and social enough that they don't let this get in the way.

The canid 'fae that do live among the Ael are concentrated in the free cities, and most often work as dockhands, barge handlers, guards, and similar, where eloquent communication is not strictly necessary. 
Most learn a local Ael'daal sign language dialect as their primary means of communication, and many also learn to write the writen language of the region. 
This is usually supplemented by poor, barked imitations of a small number of spoken Ael words. 

These different lifestyles lead to a rather wide distribution of Canid 'fae.
About a third keep to a traditional lifestyle, and are mostly found in central Eaos. This includes larger groups like the Eastern Valley circuit.
Two-fiths live among the non-shapeshifter Ael, mostly among the free cities, but also among the Riftlanders, Eaos republic, and the western regions of Kita Lau. 
This includes the semi-traditional family bands which make their living among the Ael.
The remainder live among other Daal'fae caravans not comprised primarly of canid 'fae, and among the shapeshifter commune.

Canid 'fae which keep to a traditionalist lifestyle wear lightweight clothing of leather and hide, occasionally with a fur trim. They typically have piercins, and sometimes adorn themselves with bodypaint.
They also carry leather sachels or backpacks with bone fittings. They may carry flint or obsidian knives, but usually do not carry larger tools or weapons, which are bulky enough to make overland travel difficult.
They may construct temporary tools when the situation demands, such as fishing rods, spears, snare traps, and basic shelters.

Naturalized canid fae generally adapt to match the practices of the society they have joined, and are therefore quite varied in appearance and behaviour. 

## Northern Clans (Mið'fae)

Originating from the Æl'midh, inhabit the forested regions near the territories of the Æl'midh and the northerneastern reaches of the
Æl'daal territories. Many of the clans have good relations with the local Æl'midh and Æl'daal.

The Midh'fae are characterized by having purely human and purely animal forms, unlike the Daal'fae and Xhal'fae, which have a more hybrid humanoid form. While they can also take a half form, they usually do not.
Midh'fae retain some traits accross either form, such as enhanced sences, and the ability to make certain vocalizations. 

All the mhid'fae clans - wolf, bear, and seal - periodically gather to exhange news and goods at an Aeldar fae ruin incorporating a dragon skull.

### Wolf Clan

Wolf 'fae look similar to 'midh when in their human form, but tend to be somewhat darker skinned. 
Clans consist of a single extended family, with one primary mating pair(This equates to the couple, their parents and grandparents, various single siblings, uncles, and cousins). 
This gives typical pack sizes of 6-20 individuals. Parents and grandparents generally stay with the pack of their oldest child, with younger children leaving to form their own new packs. 
Established packs have a fixed territory, such that single elder children usually encounter wandering wolves (who are second children or younger) as potential mates. 
This practice helps to avoid dominance strugles that could result if the eldest children of two established packs were to join. 
Wolf fae are generally monogamous, and mate for life. Inheritance (mainly of property) is through the first child. Second and younger children may inherit posessions and heirlooms when
they leave the pack. Wolf 'fae generally dwell in extensive cave systems. Their dwellings hae a fairly communal layout. These caves tend to have elaborately carved pillars and walls, 
and are decorated with carved bone and other trophies. Dwellins typically have a single large firepit in the main common room, and are otherwise furnished primarily with fur rugs. 
Within their caves they may take human or wolf form, but are almost always in wolf form when they leave their caves.
When in human form, they will often wear simple fur wraps and cloaks, with clasps made of carved bone. They will use stone or iron knives for skinning their prey when they want furs 
(most often deer or rabbits, but sometimes foxes, and occasionally bears), and often trade furs and scrimshaw to the 'daal and 'midh. They usually eat meat raw, 
but will smoke and salt excess meat to provide a backup food supply in the winter when prey is scarce. 

Wolf 'fae packs are comprised of 70% natural shapeshifters, 20% direbeasts, and 10% non-shapeshifter humans

Wolf fae are most common on mainland Mhidda, but there are a small number of clans on the Dhaigean Isles as well.
Of the 'Mihd fae, they can be found the furthest south, with some living within the borders of the Elyos Rebublic.


### Bear Clan

In the northern Dhaigean Isles, there is a small community of fae who first took the form of bears long ago, during the origin of the midh fae.
Initially, their animal forms were quite tiny, but over the course of several generations they gradualy became indistinguishable from the regular bears found throughout northern Mhidda.
This size increase carried through to their human form, and they are now 8-9 ft tall giants when not in bear form.
Most 'daal and many 'midh believe they don't exist and believe the rumors of giants to be merely rumors. 

The bear clan is fairly peaceful, subsisting as mostly as gatherers, and also cultivate behives and berry patches.
Of the Midh fae, they are perhaps the most sophisticated architects, building large houses out of rough-hewn wood.

They also craft clothing out of cedar bark, with some fur and leather if they can trade it from the wolf fae.

### Selkies 
A few clans of seal shapeshifters in the far north. Culturally similar to inuit.
Form large communities of 100-200 individuals, may also include wolf fae. 
Trades fish to wolf fae in exchange for furs and leather, and to bear fae in exchange for honey, berries, and wood.
Selkie fae can hold their breath almost as long (close to an hour) in their human form as in their seal form.


Selkie clanns are found throughout coastal Mhidda, but are most common on the Dhaigean Isles and in the extreme northern reaches of the mainland.
A handful of clans can also be found across the Dragon’s Teeth archepelago, as the only Ael' inhabitants of those isles.

## Jungle Tribes (Xhal'fae)

Originating from the Æl'xhal, inhabit the jungle in the northwestern reaches of Xuon and the Kita Lau isles. 
Comprised of various feline tribes (jaguars, leopards, tigers). Most Xhal'fae take on a humanoid
form, but with notable animal features. They are still competent shapeshifters, but tend to use this ability to optimize their shape to
the current situation rather than taking on a purely human or animal form.

Xhal'fae are the newest, and most animalistic of all the fae lineages. They care little for modesty regardless of what shape they are in,
and will hunt, kill, and eat just about anything that is not 'fae. Most Xhal'fae do not wear clothing, use tools, or build structures. 
Xhal'fae 'clans' consist of a loosely organized group of individuals. Clan members tend to have their own dwelling, be it a cave, crevice, treetop nest, rudimentary hut or lean-to, or portion of ruins. 
In case of outside threats, the group will usually elect a warleader (generally through physical competition) but otherwise clans have no specific leader. 

Xhal'fae are frequently polygamous and rather prolific. Romantic relationships usually consist of heterosexual pairs, but may consist of larger groups as well. 
Relationships generally don't last longer than a few months to a year, and may or may not result in a child, although longer relationships are not unheard of. 
As with most natural cat species, mothers usually raise their children alone (in part for the safety of the children) although may be assisted by other females.

All Xhal'fae are competent hunters. Some have other specialized skills, including herbalists, craftspeople, and shamans. Unlike most other fae clans, Xhal'fae tribes often include members representing a variety of feline species. 
There are some slightly more 'civilized' tribes of Xhal'fae on the northeastern outskirts of the Xuon jungle. These 'fae often craft and wear jewelry made of gold, bronze, and various semiprecious stones, and live
in modified ruins. Aditionally, there are the Xencha Defiant in southern Xuon and southeastern Kita Lau, comprised of a mix of Xhal'fae and Ael'xhal.

Most Xhal'fae 'cities' are built in leftover Xeres or Uon ruins, and many Xhal'fae groups simply live in the wilderness.
Some Xhal have also formed alliances with certain Xhal'fae clans, providing periodic sacrifices in exchange for being otherwise undisturbed by the Xhal'fae.


Xhal'fae tribes tend to be about two-thirds natural shapeshifters and two-fifths direbeasts with the remainder comprised of non shapeshifter humanoids, which retain the animalistic appearance of the typical Xhal'fae humanoid form.
A small number of Snow-leopard and tiger Xhal'fae can be found in the mountanous areas of Quon Xi. While they still keep to a fairly austere lifestyle, they tend to retain more of the trappings of civilization - 
clothes, architecture, tools, etc. - than the 'fae of Kita Lau.

During the Uon wars, most Xhal'fae got very good at masking their presence from magic, and as a consequence, many modern Xhal'fae naturallu have some form of magic resistance or evasion.

### Xhao'fae

Xhao'fae are an ancient offshoot of the Xhal'fae who mimic hexapede lizards, found across Kita Lau, and occasionally along the west cost of Quon Xi. 
They normally appear as 4 to 4 1/2 foot tall humanoid reptilians with four arms, a long tail, and a line of feathers running down their spine.
Despite being much shorter than most humans, the extra limbs and tail mean they weigh about the same. Unlike most 'fae, Xhao'fae have no inherent shapeshifting ability. 
The only remanants of their fae ancestry are the ability to form and dismiss webbing between their digits for swimming, and membranes between their limbs for gliding.
Additionally, magic-users among them retain a natural affinity for shapeshifting, so Xhao'fae shamans and mages often learn how to shapeshift.
Xhao'fae civilization is most similar to that of the Ael'xhal, although they have a tendancy to build higher up in the trees. 

Despite their reptillian form, Xhao'fae are still fertile with other Aeldar, though less so than with other Xhao'fae. Children of such pairings most often look like their mother.

## Thal'fae

Avian
Blending of elemental savants and animal shapeshifters.

Shift arms to wings, feet to feathered claws
Wings are used primarily for maneuvering, with the majority of lift coming from elementalism


Close relations with the small number of 'jinn that live on Quon Xi.

Primarily live among the stony spires in southern Quon Xi.

## Other 'fae
There are also a few small groups of unique 'fae not directly related to any of the major bloodlines:


### Merfae
Serpentfish shapeshifters most often found around Kita Lau, and in the southern Eaos isles.
Much like the Xhao'fae, they cannot shift between forms, and instead remain in a half-form with a fishlike tail and a humanlike body, including gills along their neck and torso.
Many Merfae mages do learn shapeshifting abilities, but they most often tend towards chimeric shapeshifting, taking on characteristics of various deep-sea beasts.
Relatively civilized compared to the Xhal'fae, often wear jewelry and wield fishing spears or tridents. Otherwise most similar to the 'xhal and Xhal'fae
Often have good relations with the Xhao'fae.

### Deep Fae

A more primal offshoot of the Daal'fae, these 'fae live northeast of the Dragonspine mountains, and rarely come into contact with civilized peoples. 
They spend most of their time in full animal form and rarely take human form. For the most part they are indistinguishable from direbeasts. 
Deep Fae tribes are about one-third natural shapeshifters and two-thirds direbeasts. Tribes include Deer, Cougar, Bear, and Wolf. The Queen of Ravens makes her home in the territory of the Deep Fae.
Because the wild regions where they live are quite extensive, and are not inhabited by any other sapient peoples apart from dragons, the Deep fae have a rather large population relative to other fae groups, 
comprising about one fifth of all 'fae.

## High fae
High fae are incredibly powerful shapeshifters capable of taking any number of forms at will. 
High fae are effectively immortal due to their shapeshifting magic, and generally have no 'true' form, although often have a preferred form. 
High fae are quite rare, and most are from the age of the Ældar, before the modern fae tribes were formed, and as such are rather different than modern fae. 

Unlike the High 'jinn who regularly live among modern 'jinn, High 'fae rarely take part in modern 'fae society.

## Fae Cities

Vast majority of fae populaton exist in small to medium size tribes (between 10 and 60 individuals) spanning a single extended familly.

However, there are a few larger fae population centers.
 - The shapeshifter comune in western Eaos is probably the largest of these, at several thousand individuals.
 - There is one very large selkie settlement of a little over a thousand individuals on the Mhidda coastline, which also hosts a couple of wolf-fae families.
 - Few more large selkie settlements of a few hundered individuals each, which probably qualify as small towns
 - Steamspring den is an ancient wolf fae settlement encompassing an extensive network of caves and geothermal pools. It has grown to several hundred individuals, 
an order of magnitude larger than what would otherwise be considered a large wolf fae tribe, and has a fairly unique hierarchy. 
 - Midh'fae meeting place has a moderate number of permanent inhabitants, with a disproportionate volume of shamans, although is still smaller than most of the other examples here. 
 It is mainly unique in that its population comes from a wide variety of tribes.
 - Queen's Valley in Quon Xi hosts a large, mixed population of xhal'fae and thal'fae.
 - The Xhao'fae in Kita Lau have a couple of large towns (several hundered to a couple thousand individuals), which also host Ael'xhal and the occasional Xhal'fae.

While not actually cities, many of the Daal'fae caravans are as large or larger than the cities noted above 
Additionally, the Free Cities hosts the largest population of fae permanantly living among primarly non-fae Ael.
