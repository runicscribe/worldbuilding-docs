# Æl'xhal

The Æl'xhal originate from Xuon and the Kita Lau isles, but can also be found on the east coast of Quon Xi and the west coast of Eaos.
They are dark to olive skinned with brown, blond, or copper-colored hair that is curly or wavy. They may have brown, green, or amber eyes.
They tend to have a flat-ish facial structure

They are descended from ancient Aeldar and modern 'thal. 
Many 'xhal have relatively benign relations with the dragons of the isles.
They have a rather more adversarial relationship with the Xhal'fae, many of whom have few reservations hunting stray 'xhal as food. Relations are especially tense in the Shards of Xuon.


The oldest extant Æl'xhal civilization is [Dragonhalls](../../organizations/dragonhalls), in eastern Kita Lau.
The Western isles are part of the Quon Xi empire, and mostly mirror its culture, but are ethnicly still mainly Æl'xhal.
Outside of these two large communities, most of the rest of the isles are poplulated by [smaller independant tribes](../../organizations/xhal_nations). Many of these have a deep connection to the ocean. 

The Æl'xhal of Xuon have had a particularly rough history, starting from their domination under Xeres after the dragon war, to the conquest by the Uon, and finally the cataclysm.
The few Æl'xhal still living in the shards of Xuon are a mix of desperate survivors and violent savages, living in ancient ruins and trying to recreate the glory of a long-forgotten empire.


The 'xhal have historicaly had an affinity to scrying magic, but the magical resonance from the Uon Cataclysim killed most of the seers in Dael, so this is much weaker in the modern era.
They retain talent for weather magic, and transmutation, particularly reshaping matter.

The Xencha are a distinct offshoot of the Æl'xhal who are very closely related to the Xhal'fae, and have an affinity to magic resistance.
