# Deified Individuals

Particularily powerful entities may be revered as gods by certain groups.
Most commonly: Ascended, Dragons, Archetype Elementals and High Elementals

- Xeres Empire Dragons
  - Still a few remaining among the Xeres Remenant
    - Atrefax
- Lord Ironfire
- Whitescale
- Djinn Founders (and some of their descendants)
  - Enthu, Weth
- Talsagar - as a deity of Khaldaesm and patron of the Mountain Ascetics
- Assorted Leviathans (Followers of the Leviathan)
- Queen of the Valley
- Sage of Life


These are wraped up tighly with religion, but not all religious deities are necessary deified individuals - many gods don't exist in fact. 
Furthermore, the nature and power ascribed to a god in religion may not actually be represented by the deified individuals they are based upon.  


*Aphelia's Herald - Daemon Archetype

*The Ghost-pack - Multiform Wolf/Ice Fury

*The Wolf

## Unbound Ascended

[Unbound ascended](../../world/magic/ascended) who have been around for long enough inevitably get deified by one group or another, whether or not they are trying to.

 - Ael'syi Council
