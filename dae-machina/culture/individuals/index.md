**Name:**

**Demographics:** 

**Description:** 


Born 125 BC in the city of Armuth to a midh artificier-smith and a young daal battlemage.
Fought as a soldier right as the Uon - 'daal war began to get serious, from 108 BC - 97 BC. Leg was wounded in combat, and became a blacksmith for the war effort for another 20 years, until retiring to a small town far away 
from the fighting in 77 BC. Continued to forge masterwork swords for officers in the war, and was somewhat renowned among swordsmiths of the time.
--
During retirement, was tempering sword for [?]
Small geoup of Bandits (mostly hungry war deserters) march into town. Leader demands village's food.
Smith grabs forge hammer confronts them, but is immediately backhanded by one of the bandits and knocked to the ground, injuring her badly enough that she can't immediately get back up.
Things go south from here. Village headman confronts bandit leader, who runs him thorugh. Smith finds a preternatural burst of strength grabs unfinished sword, still hot, and rushes the bandits.
Her body continues fighting long after she should have died, and once all the bandits were dead or gone, the sword lay atop her body, still hiltless, but honed to perfection.
--
While some of the other villagers were injured in the fighting, the smith and the headman were the only casualties.
Nearby soldiers show up an (hour? day?) after the fighting. Aghast at the carnage, help with cleanup.
Smith's son and apprentice (age 13) finds blade in pile of metal scrap after cleanup & finishes it in her memory. Takes it with him a year later when he goes to join the [Uon] war.
Gave sword to a young officer when he retired from active duty, knowing it would protect them.
Near front lines during the cataclysm, and lost.
The years following were rather chaotic. Eventually found by a riftlander, sold to a wandering mercenary, who was then killed by bandits.

Soul remains in the sword. Guides combat of wielder, but can only be wielded by effectively by defenders of the innocent. Otherwise will sabotoge your actions, usually at a crucial junction.
Telepathic, but not very talkative. Only speaks to a wielder she feels kinship with 

TBD: 
* Birthdate/Deathdate; What war is she a veteran of -> Either early Uon war ~100 BC, or daal-midh conflict ~2100BC
* Sword - origionally comissioned for who?
* Fate of village she defended - destroyed, but did everyone (anyone?) escape or not?
* First wielder - righteous or evil?

**Name:**

**Demographics:** Genderfluid Panther Xhal'fae

Dark-furred feline fae with faint Jaguar spots. 
Shifts between male and female forms as expedient - sometimes to get an upper hand, somtimes just because they feel like it.
Many members of the criminal underworld think they are actually brother and sister.

Normally wears a wide leather belt around their waist, with daggers, poison, lockpicks, and various other tools, and nothing else.
Occasionally sports a pair of bracers or anklets if they need to carry more.

Assassin and high-end mercenary - murders, heists, etc. Doesn't do guard duty. Mostly in it of the thrill of the hunt. 
Highly compettitive in all aspects - this extends to negotiating payment, and as a consequence they have ammassed quite a fortune. 
Not wanting the hassle of managing this coin, they've hired stewards to take care of assets and maintain safehouses across most of the Free cities.
This has only caused their fortune to grow, even with a generous percent going to their stewards. A couple have gotten greedy, and regretted it. 
No one else has made the same mistake since news about what happend to them spread (the first one eaten alive, the second subjected to death by 1000 cuts over the course of a week, with his parts spread throught the city).

Parents were displaced from Quon Xi by the Uon war and resulting cataclysm. Born in the shapeshifter city. 
Parents returned to Quon Xi, they made there way to Blackport in their early teens

Unique among chimeric shapeshifters in that he is just as adept at shaping limbs from stone as from flesh, or converting between the two.
Also unusually capable at changing his size, mostly because spare stone is a lot easier to acquire than spare flesh.

<h3 id="aelthal">Æl'thal</h3>

**Name:** Emperor ___ the Eternal

**Demographics:** Ascended M Æl'thal Gestalt

**Description:** 


Immortal ruler of the Empire of the Rising Sun

The emperor's consciousness is actually held in a thick gold and jade necklace with a large emerald at its center.
Whoever wears this necklace is considered the emporer; when a new emporer is crowned, they are bestowed the necklace as a symbol of their position.
Initially, it acts as a repository of knowledge, and can provide guidance. As the years go by, the thoughts of the new emperor merge with the conciousness of the necklace, until they are indistinguishable.
In this manner, it can be said that the Empire has had the same ruler for the last 2100 years, even if the body sitting in the throne has been different.

The necklace is capabale of fully dominating the mind of new bearers, but generally reserves this for cases of theft and asssasination. If its body is killed, it can also puppet the corpse, but cannot do so indefinately.
The gestalt conciousness within the neclace also provides its bearer with supernatural perception, the ability to have multiple parallel streams of conciousness, an eidedic memory spaning the entire Second 'Thal Dynasty, 
mastery over several martial art forms, and exemplary persuasion skills.

The necklace also hosts a number of other enchantments: enhanced durability, an enchantment which grants the wearer improved vitality and faster healing, 
and a minor charm enchantment which, when worn, can be used to capture the attention of observers, and when not worn will compel anyone who picks up the necklace to put it on.

The true nature of the emperor is known only to a select few. Most think the neclace is a baddge of office and historical relic, and the title of is "Eternal" either a descriptor of the Empire itself, 
or a reference to the fact that the title of Emperor has been held by the same unbroken family line since the beginning of the 2nd dynasty.


Unlike most autocratic governments, rulership of the Empire passes onto the heir (typically the Emperor's firstborn son) upon their coming-of age, instead of the death of the current emperor.
This tradition started because the entity in the necklace much prefers a younger body, and has now been going on long enough that it is just seen as normal.
Often, the new Emperor retains some of the wives he had in his past incarnation.

There have been a few instances where the emperor did not produce a son, only daughters. Usually, this resulted in the rulership passing to the Emperor's first grandson by his eldest daughter, but in at least one instance,
there were no male heirs when the current Emperor died, and the title instead passed to a female heir.

When the mantle of emporer does pass over, the old Emporer's conciousness has typically entirely merged with the necklace, and if his old body is still alive it reverts to a semi-vegetative state, 
and is moved to a secret retreat where it is cared for, in part as a backup in case something unfortunate happens to the Emperor's new body.

<h3 id="gyldraed">Gyldraed</h3>



**Name:** The Ghost of Aelmos

**Demographics:** City Dryad

**Description:** 
About 6000 years old. First City Dryad to come into being.
Diminished since fall of Aelmos, but still exceptionally powerfull.

Typically manifests an avatar as a ruined statue garbed in shards of porcelein and veils of sand. Will often manifest more than one such avatar at a time.
Ocassionally, when it wants to intimidate, if manifests a titanic form of pillars, ruined buildings, and waterfalls of sand.

Fully capable of communicating telepathically, but prefers to shape the sand and stone of the ruins into moving images to communicate information.
Most people who interact find this to be needlessly cryptic, but those that do manage to communicate telepathically with it often regret it, as they are assailed with a deep lonliness underlying all its mental communications.
Closer relations with humans than most dryads, especially after the fall - has formed enduring friendships with a number of especially adventurous historians who braved the journey to the ruins of Aelmos.
A handful of these have remained in the ruins past their death, in the form of soulbound spirits, continuing this friendship beyond their death.

Replays city life, filling in holes with sand and stone.
Often speculative in nature - rather than mimic past events, constructs what-if scenerios based on the people of that time.

Not especially dangerous, but will stop anyone from trying to take artifacts from the city. Also doesn't like fighting within its boundaries, and will forcibly try and prevent any violence.
The biggest danger to humans in its domain is starvation or thirst - while it may want to help, there is virtually no food or water suitable for human consumption within its domain, so is unable to do so.
