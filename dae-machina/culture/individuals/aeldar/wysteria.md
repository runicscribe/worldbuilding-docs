## Biography

Her Father is a 'daal battlemage in the Uon war who retired to a settlement at the edge of the riftlands, and made a liveleyhood selling Uon artifacts from the riftlands.
Mother was a 'xhal hunter displaced by the war. Both would make frequent expeditions into the rift to reclaim artifacts, and Wysteria followed in the family trade.

Wysteria followed allong on riftland expeditions with her parents from her early teens.
In her late teens, Wysteria began running goods to the AoMMA to sell some of the more unique artifacts to the researches and mages there, while her father remained at home to run the shop.
These expeditions were usually coupled with a season of ad-hoc classes at the Academy, which helped to hone her magical skills. During this time, Wysteria discovered a particular gift for teleportation.
<Note: Trip from Rift Overlook to AoMMA is about 2 mths by boat>

By her early twenties, Wysteria was running solo expeditions into the riftlands, parents mostly retired from running expeditions.
Still occasionally to ran goods to AoMMA, but spent less time there when she did go - generally half the year in the riftland, and half the year running goods to the Free Cities, and/or the AoMMA, 
which only allowd for a few weeks there. Some years, would only travel as far upriver as Kenford instead of taking the full trip to AoMMA.

Met <artificier mage> in his 2nd year at Academy, in 52 AC. They bonded over a mutual interest in magical artifacts, and <artificier> made Wisteria a set of feather-fall greaves.
In the intervening time between Wysterias next Academy visit, <artificier> made Wysteria's gauntlet, with the promise of an interesting artifact when she next visited.

Wysteria found an especially powerful Uon spear in 55 AC, and started taking on more varied work - still mostly artifact retrieval, but more often specific artifacts for wealthy clients, and no longer just in the riftlands.
<Artificier> joined in on a couple of the more tame ones (and did eventually go on a couple expeditions in the riftlands) 

Died 87 AC to a particularly deadly ruin in the Southwest Eaos Desert.
