**Description:** 

Dark, brown-grey skin, bald, and androgynous. Indeterminate Age. 
Mineral veins show through their few wrinkles. Nails appear to be made of polished gold. Looks otherwise human, though their skin is hard as stone to the touch.

Patron of Earth.

**Name:** Weth, the Bounteous

**Demographics:** Male Eldar 'Daal

**Description:** 
Born 2987 BC, in Old Aelmos

Typically maintains the form of a muscular, dark-skinned male 'daal, much the same as how he appeared at 35.
Barechested, with waist-wrap of blue silk and copious jewelry of bronze and other materials.


Origionally a weather-mage, more skilled in elementalism than shapeshifting. Already a skilled mage during the exodus from Aelmos, and helped ensure their success. Eldest of the four patrons, and the most prolific.
Patron of water. Parent of Talsar.

In the current age, nominal overseer of the 'jinn principalities agriculture and climate, although in practice others run the day-to-day operations, he mostly only intervenes during crises.
Normally, he spends time travelling between cities to attend various high-society events, and mentoring younger 'jinn. Still quite attached to earthly pleasures - food, sex, etc., unusually so for an Eldar.

Retains immense talent in weather and water magic from his youth. Now also skilled in healing magic, and various forms of transmutation (although still not especially skilled in shapeshifting).

**Name:** The Stoneshaper

**Demographics:** Male Earth 'jinn / Chimeric Shapeshifter

**Description:** 

Normally appears as a 9 foot tall centaur chimera formed from sandstone or marble, with a humanoid torso, and the heads of mythical beasts at the base of his torso.
Other times, takes the form of a sandworm, with a humanoid torso in place of a tongue.
Unique among chimeric shapeshifters in that he is just as adept at shaping limbs from stone as from flesh, or converting between the two.
Also unusually capable at changing his size, mostly because spare stone is a lot easier to acquire than spare flesh.

One of the few non-Dragons who can and does use petrification magic.

Was a protoge of the shaper of new Aelmos, some hundred years after the founding of the city.

**Name:**

**Demographics:** Female Ester's Lineage 'jinn / Chimeric shapeshifter

**Description:** 

In her most personable shape, looks like an olive-skinned Aeldar of indeterminate lineage.
Opaque black ooze covers her body from collarbones to the ground, miming the form of a black dress, and extending into the ground itself, innundating the earth and filling cracks between stone.
In this manner, she carries quite a bit of biomass with her, like most chimeric shapeshifters, albiet in a concealed way.
This guise does not really work well far to the north, where the ground is impermeable due to permafrost, or in any other locations covered in an impenetrable surface.

Her specuialty is shaping disconected body parts out of her ooze - eyes, teeth, tentacles, etc.
She can also spread her body over fairly large areas - up to a couple kilometers in diameter - in order to keep an eye or an ear on things. However, she is not a full multiform shapeshifter. 

A little over 200 years old.
