<img src="../../images/xeres_suncrowned.png" alt="Xeres Suncrowned, a spined dragon with flat-tipped horns" class="img-right">

**Name:** Xeres Suncrowned

**Demographics:** M Spined Dragon

**Description:** 

Born 5600 BC.

Xeres was at the forefront at the Dragon War in Xuon, and lead the negotiations with the Ael'Xhal. Claimed a fertile valley, already well-populated with Ael, as his territory and claimed tribute from them.
Initially, Xeres and his allies only claimed a moderate portion of Xeres, with the dragons of other regions making their own negotiations.

After the dragon war, Xeres involved himself in inter-Dragon politics on Xuon, convincing the other dragons of the continent to allow the Ael of his empire into their territory, in return for tribute from these new inhabitants.
In this way, the Xeres empire expanded across all of Xuon.

This empire-building gave Xeres a great deal of social and political power among dragonkind, especially on and around Xuon.
Over the course of his reign, Xeres sired eleven children, most by different mothers, an almost unheard of number for a dragon.

Xeres died alongside his empire in 2400 BC, during the Uon invasion of Xuon.

Lives in Dragonhalls - child of current leader and a Spined dragon she met in Xuon (or the Enjat peninsula?). Never met his father.
Born in 2600 BC.

Considered particularly eccentric by other dragons.
He had several close relations with humans in his youth, which is unusual for a dragon.

Carvedscale is percieved as vain and hedonistic by most, which isn't an inaccurate assesment.
However, he is also closely in touch in touch with the human population of Dragonhalls, and knows the family history of many of its citizens, going back 2000 years.
Consequently, he acts as a deputy leader of Dragonhalls alongside Turi, and typically runs the northen half of the state.

Around 1,500 AC, Carvedscale becomes the only known artificial city-dryad, merging with the nascent soul of the city.

**Name:**  ___ Riftscarred

**Demographics:** 

**Description:** 


Milk-white eyes.
Wing membranes aren't tattared, but the mass of overlapping scars make them look like it.

Born 7100 BC

Already an elder and a powerfull sorcerer at the time of the Dragon war, though didn't do much to participate in it.
While not one of the founding members of the Xeres Empire, was one of the first few dragons to join it. Didn't engage much in the day to day activities of the empire, but enjoyed the tribute.
Largely ignored the Uon invasion - A bit put out by the loss of tribute, but not enough to do much about it.

Earned the moniker Riftscarred after surviving the full force of the Uon cataclysm.

After the cataclysm, gained night-black foreclaws, and crystalline shards of darkstone growing from their forelimbs and horns. Both are surrounded by a weirdly angular heat-haze effect.

One of the very few dragons still living in the riftscape after the cataclysm (and the only one who was within the area of the main rift during the cataclysm, and survived). 
___'s magic has made their lair into an unnaturally stable region of the rift.

One of the most powerfull magical beings to currently exist on Dael. 
Most notable feats include visiting the surface of Aurum, and swimming through the mantle of Dael (and returning with a 300 kg diamond) (with surviving the cataclysm a distant third).

Solitary. Barely tolerates the presence of other dragons, and largely disregards the existance of Ael.
