# Technology

## Travel

Primary method of land travel is by foot. (16 - 30 km / day, **20** km/day avg)
Due to their animal forms, fae on average travel faster - up to **50** km/day

Sea travel - relatively sophisticated sailing ships - 100 - 200 km/day
  Sea - 9 - 18.5 km/h;  100 - 200 km/day; **150** average
  Upriver 5.6 km/h; **60** km/day for major rivers, 15 - 30 for smaller rivers.
  Downriver 11 - 22 km/h ; **120** - 240 km/day
  
### Teleportation

Over any significant distance, requires some form of potent focci at both source an destination
(Specifically, a pair of sympathetically resonant items, e.g. two halves of a ten-thousand year glacial boulder, which must be transported to each destination without use of magic to retain potency)
As such, teleportation networks are mostly limited to large, well funded nations.
Paired portals are a little more common
Also some legacy systems by prior empires, but these are a bit risky / unreliable.

Mostly used for transporting important people and food (esp. during emergencies).
Damages sympathetic properties of raw materials, so cannot be used for transport of materials used in magical workings.
Drains stored magical energy.
Both these evects are only partial, but magnitude is proportional to distance and number of trips.
Does not significanly harm worked goods or enchanted items.
Long distance also requires a significant amount of magical power, so used sparingly.

Notable instances.
Networks:
 - Major cities in Eaos, including hollow cities (people and cargo)
 - Major cities in 'jinn cities, including hollow cities (people and cargo)
 - Major cities across Quon Xi Empire, extending into Kita Lau (people and cargo). This is the largest active network.
 - Smaller Eldar council network built on top of the remenants of various older networks. Hidden, and dangerous for unskilled mages to use (Mostly just Eldar councilmembers)
 - (Abandoned) Core Old Aeldar network. Built during the height of the first Daal Empire, about 800 years before the lich wars. Spans the Southwest Eaos Desert, from Eaosport to the 'Jinn cities. 
    The first major network ever built. Now partly destroyed, mostly abandoned, as majority of destinations have been consumed by the desert, and few people know how it works. Parts are still usable, but dangerous.
 - (Destroyed) Daal-midh Golden-age network, built about 1000 years before the Uon-'daal war. Connected 'jinn capitol, 'midh capitol, old 'daal capitol (now Eaosport), and a now-destroyed city on the southeast coast of Eaos. 
    Damaged by the Uon cataclysm, and now unsafe.
 - (Destroyed) Network between Eaosport, AoM&MA, and Teythmos; damaged in the Uon war during an attack on Eaos. No longer in active use, but a strong enough mage could still make it work for a small group of people.
Dedicated pair between AoM&MA and Teythmos

Clandestine pair between Blakport and Elgate
