# Laws


## Magic

Laws regarding magic are very varied across the various nations in Dae'machina. Some of these stem from historical or cultural reasons, others are more practical.

### Physical Magics

Laws governing the use of most physical magics are pretty simple - generally, any damage or harm perpetrated through such magic is treated the same as if the culprit had used mundane means to accomplish the same.

#### Counterfeiting

Due to its relative ease, use of transmutation for counterfeighting is treated more harshly than counterfeighting through normal means.
This mainly applies to the Futhern Dhal in Mhidda, Elyos Republic, Free Cities, and to a lesser extent, Riftlanders. 
Only reason Empire of Quon Xi is not on the list as well as punishment for any form of counterfeighting is already public execution, so can't get much more harsh. 


### Necromancy

Any necromrancy involving the creation of undead very illegal in Elyos and the 'jinn cities, and among the Eaosian fae (although as they do not have an organized government as such, this is more a strong taboo).
One exception is the hyenid 'daal fae, who have no taboo against necromrancy, and utilize it occasionally.

This ban does not encompass magic involved in speaking to or banishing existing undead, or forensic magic, both of which are permitted.
Necromrancy is also illegal in the Free Cities, but less strongly enforced. These laws all stem strong cultural taboos that originated in the aftermath of lich wars that occured in 2900 BC in central Eaos.

There are no laws or taboos against necromrancy across the shards of Xuon, and the only laws against it across the Kita Lau isles mostly concern the desecration of corpses.
Necromrancy is somewhat more regulated in Quon Xi. Reanimating human bodies is mostly illegal, although still permitted under certain circumstances.
Reanimating animal bodies is permitted for the most part, as long as the the animal was not owned by someone else, and the result is not dangerous.  

Among the 'midh, use of necromrancy on the bodies of 'midh citizens is forbidden. Use on thralls and non-'midh is permitted with some restrictions, and use on on animal bodies is not regulated at all.
The Midh'fae do not have any laws against necromrancy, but also do not typically use it.

### Mental Magic

In Elyos, the Free cities, and the Riftlander Cities, all forms of mental magic are deeply distrusted, due to the recent war with the psionic Uon.
Benign forms of mental magic are not forbidden, including basic (consenual) telepathy, truthsaying, and mental protection.

However, any nonconsensual mental magic - basic mind reading, altering memories, mind control, etc. - is very illegal, and treated similar to assault or rape.
In the AoM&MA (and most other Eaosian mage schools), there is less of a cultural taboo against mind magic, but the laws are still the same, so it is not studied especially deeply.
Most practitioners learn it to bind familiars and not much else. Communication over long distances is most frequently done using a mix of scrying and channelling, rather than telepathy. 

The Xhal and Xhal'fae inhabittion the shards of Xuon have similar feelings on mental magic. As they were affected much more severely by the war, and still have not really been able to rebuild, they have 
a rather less functional legal system than the Eaosian nations, so suspected practitioners of mental magic are usually just killed on the spot.

The 'jinn principalities, the 'midh, the 'xhal of the Kita Lau isles, and most groups of Daal'fae are all rather more accepting of mental magic. 
For the 'jinn and the 'fae, even non-consensual telepathy isn't considered any worse than eavesdropping. Among all these groups, altering the minds of others is still treated quite harshly.

As they were not touched by the Uon war, the continent of Quon Xi does not have the same reservations against mental magic, and uses it as casually as any other magic.

### Scrying

Generally, most uses of scrying are permitted.
The primary exception is use of scrying to view private places or information. The specifics of how this is treated vary widely, and can depend on the precise method of scrying used. Sometimes it treated more like telepathy, 
and sometimes the same as mundane spying.

Scying is often hard to detect, and finding the culprit can be even more difficult, so many nominal crimes of this sort go unpunished. Those that are caught tend to be larger, sustained efforts, and are therefore 
tend towards the harsher side of legally mandated punishments.

### Encantation

Use of encantation for the supression of magic, or use of magic-supressing materials, is closely regulated in the 'jinn principalities, the Quon Xi Empire, and most mage academies or guilds.
In the Elyos Republic and Futhern Dhal, and several states across Kita Lau, only magic supressing materials are regulated, as they are categorized as objects of military interest.

Notably, such magic is largely unregulated in the Free Cities and the Riftlander cities, as well as among most groups of 'fae.




## Crime and Punishment

The nations of Dael each have variying philosophies and approaches to crime and punishment. Broadly, these incorporate some mix of the following objectives:

 - Retribution – Punishment of criminals as the primary goal. "Eye-for-an-Eye" and such.
 - Deterrence – Punishment as a means to prevent crime, both by discouraging criminals not to re-offend, and by discouraging the citizenship from commiting crimes in the first place. 
   Methods vary, and can include finacial or corporal punishments.
 - Incapacitation – Actions which keep criminals away from society so that the public is protected from their misconduct. This includes imprisonment, exile, or even death. 
 - Rehabilitation – Acts which attempt to prevent further offenses by convincing the offender that their conduct was wrong.
 - Restoration – A victim-oriented theory of punishment which aims to repair any injury perpetuated by the offender.

These five categories have significant overlap - as an example, a fine may be both a deterrence and rehabilitative.


Imprisonment is fairly rare on Dael, because the commonality of magic makes the construction of reliable prisons quite difficult. Antimagic materials exist, 
but are rare enough that making a mage proop prison is limited to large and wealthy nations, for prisoners of particular value.

Indentured servitude as some of the same problems, but this is usually mitigated by threat of a worse punishment.

Even relatively unskilled mages can detect magic, so there usually aren't any concerns about use of magic to manipulate the outcome of trials and such.

### Elyos Republic

The Elyos Republic nominally belives in restorative and rehabilitive justice, although the restorative aspect is mainly towards the state rather than any wronged party.

Most punishments for petty crimes are fines. Those who can't pay either have their income claimed by the republic, or are subject to community service.
There is a robust legal system for dealing with civil disputes.

### Free Cities

The Free Cities have quite a similar justice system to the Elyos Republic, but it tends to be a bit more corrupt, with fewer checks and balances.
It also focuses more on deterance and retribution, despite using simalar methods to Elyos.

#### Blackport
Blackport is rather more lawless than the rest of the Free Cities. Nominally "anything goes", although if you interfere the city guard or the Lord's council, then things could go quite poorly for you.
Despite being a small, independant city-state, Blackport has large magic-proofed prison. Historically, this was by the old Elyos Empire for holding political prisoners. Nowadays, its put to a variety of uses, 
from hiding individuals from scrying eyes, to holding nobles for ransom. It even occasionally serves as a drunk tank for some of the more renown mercenary groups who pass through Blackport.   

### Futhern Dal

Mainly restorative justice system.
Wereguld

### Drakkar

Actually quite similar to Futhern Dal.
Can't pay, become a thrall.


### Daal 'fae Caravans

Larger caravans have a somewhat developed legal system.
The cervid daal'fae are traditionally pacifists, and this is reflected in their punishments.

Worst crimes are punished by exile from the caravan.
Lesser crimes restitution or service to the wronged party - pulling wagons.
Focus on restorative and rehabilitative justice.
Civil disputes are settled by arbutration by the matriarch or council of matriarchs, as applicable.

### Canid Tribes

Groups are small family pods, so they don't really have a formal legal system.

### Lion Tribes.

Mostly corporal punishment system
Whipping, exposure, etc.
Mutilation for especially serious crimes.

Focus on retribution and deterance.

Civil disputes / disagreements are settled through dueling.


### Shapeshifter Commune

A ban on grievous violence and murder are the only truly hard laws in the commune. 
Typically punished by exile, particularly henious acts may fall to execution instead.
Mix of lawlessness and incapacitation

### Empire of the Rising Sun

Petty crimes - temporary servitude, although often can pay to get out of it, at pleasure of the magistrate.

Most crimes against the state are punished by excecution, carried out through especially brutal public spectacle.

Mainly focused on deterence.


### Ael'jinn Principalities

Punishments focus on deterance or incapacitation.

Everyone being a potent elemental shapeshifter has interesting results.
Punishments tend to actually be quite severe, but the Principalities are close enough to a post-scarcity society that crime is exceptionally rare.
Most often comes up as an unpleasant (and sometimes final) surprise for non-'jinn visitors.

### Xeres Reborn

Mostly up to the whims of whomever the current leader of a given settlement is. Tend to be brutal and bloody. Main focus is retribution, and to a lesser ectend deterrence.

### Xencha Remnant

Softened up somewhat since times of the Xeres Empire and later Uon occupation, but still tend towards brutal and efficient, stemming from need for organization and secrecy in earlier times.
Punishments primarily focused on keeping everyone else save, as often the slightest disruption was enough to bring down the Empire or the Uon (and therefore, deterrence/incapacitation)

### Dragonhalls

Nominal shared legal system between dragons and humans, which makes equitable punishments for those who break the laws challenging.
This has resulted in a mostly restorative justice system.
