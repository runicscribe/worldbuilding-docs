# Laws


## Magic

Laws regarding magic are very varied across the various nations in Dae'machina. Some of these stem from historical or cultural reasons, others are more practical.

### Necromancy

Any necromrancy involving the creation of undead very illegal in Elyos and the 'jinn cities, and among the Eaosian fae (although as they do not have an organized government as such, this is more a strong taboo).
Note that this does exclude magic involved in speaking to or banishing existing undead, as well as a variety of forensic magic.
Necromrancy is also illegal in the Free Cities, but less strongly enforced. These laws all stem stron cultural taboos that originated in the aftermath of lich wars that occured in 2900 BC in central Eaos.
