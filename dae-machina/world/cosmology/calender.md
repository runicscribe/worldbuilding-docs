# Calender

The unique cosmology of this world leads to an equally unique calender.

Each day is 24 hours long.
At the equator, dawn is at 06:00 and dusk is at 18:00. This remains the case the further north or south you travel, but the sun does not reach as high in the sky. 
The poles are in a constant state of dusk, with the sun and other greater spheres constantly drifting near the horizon
Each week (i.e. "hekad") is 6 days long. This is the same as the orbital period of the
Sun and the Darksun.

| Weekday | Common Name (Eaos) | Common Name (Mhidda) | Old Aeldar Name | Translated Name  |
|---------|--------------------|----------------------|-----------------|------------------|     
| 1       | Helisday / Helsday | Firdas ("Fire Day")  | Kanakad         | 'Zenith Day'     |
| 2       | Larsday            | Durdas               | Aldad           | 'First Day'      |
| 3       | Somday             | Erldas               | Sestad          | 'Quiet Day'      |
| 4       | Ursday             | Wyrdas ("War Day")   | Unuad           | 'Umbra Day'      |
| 5       | Raesday            | Hondas               | Eartad          | 'End Day'        |
| 6       | Easday             | Morndas              | Hakad           | 'Resurgance Day' |

Each month (i.e. "kahda") is 36 days (6 weeks). This is the orbital period of the
Coppermoon.

Each year (i.e. "lokan") is 252 days (7 months; 42 weeks). The beginning of each year
coincides with a full alignment of the three moons.

| Month | Common Name (Eaos) | Old Aeldar Name | Translated Name | Convergence events |

| 2     | Tekahd             | Akta            | 'Honor'         | Gold/Copper convergence at day 27 |

| 6     | Pakhad             | Ahatara         | 'Valor'         | Gold/Copper convergence at day 9 |
| 7     | Convergence        | Khana           | 'Completion'    | Full convergence at day 36 |



## Example Dates



Helisday, the first of Divergence, AC 57

(Note: Year numbering is a little odd - Cataclysm occurd at convergence halfway through year, AC 0. AC 1 starts at the first full convergence after the cataclysm)
