# Calender

The unique cosmology of this world leads to an equally unique calender.

Each week (i.e. "hekad") is 6 days long. This is the same as the orbital period of the
Sun and the Darksun.

| Weekday | Common Name (Eaos) | Common Name (Mhidda) | Old Aeldar Name | Translated Name  |
|---------|--------------------|----------------------|-----------------|------------------|     
| 1       | Helisday / Helsday | Firdas ("Fire Day")  |                 | 'Zenith'         |
| 2       | Larsday            | Durdas               |                 |  |
| 3       | Somday             | Erldas               |                 | 'Quietus'        |
| 4       | Ursday             | Wyrdas ("War Day")   |                 | 'Umbra' |
| 5       | Raesday            | Hondas               |                 |  |
| 6       | Easday             | Morndas              |                 | 'Resurgance'     |

Each month (i.e. "kahda") is 36 days (6 weeks). This is the orbital period of the
Coppermoon.

Each year (i.e. "lokan") is 252 days (7 months; 42 weeks). The beginning of each year
coincides with a full alignment of the three moons.

| Month | Common Name (Eaos) | Old Aeldar Name | Translated Name | Convergence events |
|-------|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------------|     
| 1     | Divergence         |                 | 'Birth'         | Full convergence at day 0 |
| 2     |                    |                 | 'Honor'         | Copper/Gold convergence at day 27 |
| 3     |                    |                 | 'Forgetfullness'| Copper/Silver convergence at day 9 |
| 4     |                    |                 | 'Truth'         | Copper/Gold convergence, and Silver anticonvergence at day 18 |
| 5     |                    |                 | 'Secrecy'       | Copper/Silver convergence at day 27 |
| 6     |                    |                 | 'Valor'         | Copper/Gold convergence at day 9 |
| 7     | Convergence        |                 | 'Completion'    | Full convergence at day 36 |
      
The Sun and Darksun each take 6 days (1 week) to orbit the planet. The
coppermoon takes 36 days


## Example Dates



Helisday, the first of Divergence, AC 57

(Note: Year numbering is a little odd - Cataclysm occurd at convergence halfway through year, AC 0. AC 1 starts at the first full convergence after the cataclysm)
