# World Cosmology

Earth-centric, orbited by various celestial bodies all 1/10th the
diameter of the earth. Orbiting spheres are all uniform and lifeless.
Past a few light-years, the fabric of spacetime frays into
non-Euclidean folding that makes it seem as if you are moving without
actually going anywhere. Parallel universes may exist, and pocket
dimensions are possible (As demonstrated by parts of the Riftscape)

This geocentric structure gives a short solar year (1 week). This
(coupled with
a neglegible axial tilt) means that there is no real seasonal climate
variation. Instead, the climate and the seasons are controlled by
elementals. Also, this means that there are no real lunar phases.
Additionally, since the sun is inside of the orbit of the moons, there
are no solar eclipses. However lunar eclipses, both by Terra Mendael and by the Darksun, occur on roughly weekly intervals, with a pattern that changes throughout the year. 
The major celestial bodies all manifest as some element on earth. Each
celestial shpere is comprised primarily of this material (plus
impurities, meteor impacts, oxidization, etc.). They are also covered with arcane geometric patterns.

Beyond the major celestial bodies there is a background of stars and celestial dust (comets, meteors, dust, sunfire fragments, gas, etc.)

# The Center - Terra Mendael 

The planet upon which all life exists.
9800 km in diameter/30787 km circumference (0.76911 the size of earth)
0.011 degrees/km at equator (85.5 km/degree)

Mass = 3.038e24 kg
Volume = 4.928e20 m3
Gravity is 8.445 m/s2


## Great Spheres ("Suns") - Oposing orbits. Orbital period of 6 days.
Orbits approx 1.113e8m m from the planet. Sky diameter of 30.9'.

* Sunfire - Fragile, transparent crystal. Rapidly breaks down at low
pressures (less than 1000 atm) or regions of low arcana, emmiting
massive amounts of heat, light, and arcana. Due to this, it is
extremely rare on earth and rarely lasts for long.
* Darkstone - Brittle, opaque black crystal. Excludes arcana and aether.
Durable, but explodes violently if damaged, releasing a burst of arcana.

## Lesser Spheres ("Moons")

Each of them are the same diameter - 1000 km.
The three lesser spheres come into convergence every 252 days. The [Daes calender](./calender) is based upon this convergence.

### Aurum
Gold. Good Enchanting medium. 
Orbital period of 36 days. Orbits approx 3.676e8 m from the planet. Sky diameter of 9.4'.

### Argent
Silver. Disruptive to magic. 
Orbital period of 63 days. Orbits approx 5.339e8 m from the planet. Sky diameter of 6.4'.

### Alkyne
Copper. Imprints/stores magical signatures. 
Orbital period of 84 days. Orbits approx 6.468e8 m from the planet. Sky diameter of 5.3'.



## Wandering Stars:


### Bright Wanderers

About the same size as the lesser spheres, but further away, such that they appear as large stars. Rather more erratic orbits than the lesser spheres.

Eternity - Iron.
Essence - Starmetal. Highly sensitive to magic, and will float in areas
of strong arcana. Responsible for the magical properties of meteoric
iron.
Clarity - Diamond

### Dim Wanderers

Gas giants. Significantly larger than the other spheres, but also much further away.
Mostly distributed within the celestial dust.

Firenze - Sulfer-Methane gas giant. Red-orange.
Aqua - Hydrogen-Oxygen gas giant. Blue-orange.
Aeris - Oxygen-Nitrogen gas giant. Yellow.
Gaius - Silicon-Carbon-Oxide superplanet. Gray-green.

## Celestial Dust

Stars and Meteors

The celestial dust is made of shards of the celestial spheres. Stars
are comprised primarily of starfire shards, with their colors
determined by impurities. Most meteors are comprised of fragments of
the lesser spheres.

| Darksun     | Nihilum     | Sol Noctum    | Sol Noctis      | |
| Coppermoon  | Perit       | Luna Peritus  | Luna Aeramentum | Moon of Knowledge/Copper Moon |
| Silvermoon  | Astus       | Luna Astus    | Luna Argentum   | Moon of Guile/Silver Moon
| Goldmoon    | Robur       | Luna Roburus  | Luna Aurum      | Moon of Power/Gold Moon
| Universe    |             | Dae'machina   | Dae Machina     | God's Machine
| Stars       |             | Celestias     |                 |  |


Physics Note:
The materials that comprise the celestial spheres embody the known elements.

# Celestial Magic

Because each of the spheres is a pure material, their motions have significant effects on the tides of magic.

The Eaosian Wizards are aware of this influence, and often make use of the power-amplifying effects of solar convergences. 
However, they are dismisive of the more subtler asspects, believing it a crutch to be used by hedgemages and sorcerers.

The Thal Wizards have cultivated a much deeper connection with the cosmos, and have comprehensively mapped its workings.
This synergises well with their penchant for group workings, where individual magic users can channel a single sphere.
The Thal are currently constructing a skyship to try and reach the heavens.
