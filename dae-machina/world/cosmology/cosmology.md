# World Cosmology

The system of Dae'machina is centered on the planet Terra Mendael (or Dael, as it is more commonly called).
The planet is orbited by various celestial bodies, each slightly larger than 1/10th of its diameter. These orbiting spheres are all uniform and lifeless.
At a distance greater than a few light-years from Dael, the fabric of spacetime frays into non-Euclidean folding that makes it seem as if you are moving without actually going anywhere. 
Parallel universes may exist, and pocket dimensions are possible (As demonstrated by parts of the Riftscape)

This geocentric structure gives a short solar year (1 week). This
(coupled with a neglegible axial tilt) means that there is no real seasonal climate
variation. Instead, the climate and the seasons are controlled by
elementals. Also, this means that there are no real lunar phases.
Additionally, since the sun is inside of the orbit of the moons, there
are no solar eclipses. However lunar eclipses, by Terra Mendael and by either sun, occur on roughly weekly intervals, with a pattern that changes throughout the year.
Eclipses from the suns only occur near the equator, as at more extreeme latitudes they merely pass by each other. Terra Mendael is large enough that eclipses caused by it are visible planet-wide. 
The major celestial bodies all manifest as some element on earth. Each
celestial shpere is comprised primarily of this material (plus
impurities, meteor impacts, oxidization, etc.). They are also covered with arcane geometric patterns.

Beyond the major celestial bodies there is a background of stars and celestial dust (comets, meteors, dust, sunfire fragments, gas, etc.)

## The Center - Terra Mendael 

The planet upon which all life exists.
9800 km in diameter/30787 km circumference (0.76911 the size of earth)
0.011 degrees/km at equator (85.5 km/degree)

Mass = 3.038e24 kg
Volume = 4.928e20 m3
Gravity is 8.445 m/s2

The planet spins counter to the spheres, with a period of 28.8 hours. Coupled with the rotation of the suns, this gives a 24 hour day, and a 6 day week.
The suns rise in the east, and set in the west.


## Great Spheres ("Suns")
The first of the celestial spheres are locked in identical opposing orbits, with an orbital period of 6 days.
This orbit is approx 1.113e8m m from the planet, resulting in a sky diameter of 30.9' for each of these spheres.

### Brightsun

Composed of "Sunfire", a fragile, transparent crystal. This crystal rapidly breaks down at low pressures (less than 1000 atm) or regions of low arcana, emmiting massive amounts of heat, light, and arcana. 
Due to this, it is extremely rare on Dael and seldom lasts for long. 


### Darksun

Composed of "Darkstone", a brittle, opaque black crystal that excludes arcana and aether. This material is durable, but explodes violently if damaged, releasing a burst of arcana.
The Darksun excludes all light, appearing black in color. Because it orbits opposite the Brightsun, the Darksun is only every found in the night sky, 
and is only observable when it obscures the background stars as they move through the night sky. Mages may also percieve the magical effects of the moon, especially during lunar eclipses. 

As a consequence, the Darksun is only really known by astronomers, mages, and scholars, and not by common folk.

### Auroras

Light, heat, and Arcana is constantly emitted by the Brightsun. 
Faint auroras sometimes occur in a band perpendicular to the line between the darksun and brightsun, where this energy passes through the atmosphere and then back into space.
These are most visible slightly after dusk and before dawn, and more visible the closer to either pole you go. Their intensity is affected by the lunar orbits.
In the mid-northern and mid-southern lattitudes, the direction of these bands is sometimes used to aid navigation.

## Lesser Spheres ("Moons")

The next three spheres occur in successive concentric orbits.
As with the two suns, all three have a diameter of 1000 km.
The three lesser spheres come into convergence every 252 days. The [Daes calender](./calender) is based upon this convergence.
This convergence coincides with a lunar eclipse by the Darksun. The exact time of convergence occurs near dusk over much of Eaos, and near dawn over much of Quon Xi. It is only visible from eastern Eaos and western Quon Xi.

### Aurum
Composed entirely of gold. 
Orbital period of 36 days. Orbits approx 3.676e8 m from the planet. Sky diameter of 9.4'.
Eclipsed by Dael (and the Darksun) once every 7.17 days, with 36 eclipses a year. 

### Argent
Composed entirely of silver. 
Orbital period of 63 days. Orbits approx 5.339e8 m from the planet. Sky diameter of 6.4'.
Eclipsed by Dael (and the Darksun) once every 6.69 days, with 38 eclipses a year.

### Alkyne
Composed entirely of copper. 
Orbital period of 84 days. Orbits approx 6.468e8 m from the planet. Sky diameter of 5.3'.
Eclipsed by Dael (and the Darksun) once every 6.39 days, with 40 eclipses a year.

### Eclipses

In addition to the eclipse/convergence at the start of the year, each of the moons are eclipsed by Dael every 6 to 7 days, for a total of 112 per year (counting the convergence as a single event).
These eclipses last aproximately 3 hours, and are visible at any lattitude.

Since the moons are not always visible in the night sky (spending half their time on the opposite side of the planet), the actual number of observable eclipses from any given location is around 52, 
and does not follow an especially regular schedule.

There can be up to 35 days between visible eclipses of the same moon, and up to 21 days between visible eclipses of *any* moon. 
Furthermore, since each moon is eclipsed on a slightly different cadence, there is no minimum time between eclipses of two different moons.
The convergence at the start of the year is the only time all three are eclipsed at once, but there are other times throughout the year with as little as four hours between two different eclipses.   

Because the Brightsun orbits exactly opposite the Darksun, eclipses of one of the moons by Dael always coincide with an eclipse of the same moon by the Darksun, which lasts about 10 minutes, 
and is only visible within 10 degrees of the equator (beyond that, it appears as a non-overlapping convergence instead). Since this event is so much shorter than the planetary eclipse, it is are effectively invisible, 
and only detectable through fluctuations in Aether and Arcana.

### Tides

Together, the two suns and three lesser spheres influence the tides of Dael.
The suns contribute the greatest influence, producing relatively uniform, twice daily, high tides at noon and midnight.
The range between high and low tide varies based on geography, but is typically between 1.5m and 30m.

The influence of the lesser spheres is quite minor, and is dominated by Aurum. Depending on time of year, they can alter the tidal range by up to 5%.
The largest change in range occurs on an 18-day cycle, with maximal range changing to minimal range over 9 days, with more subtle changes over the course of the year.

#### Regional Ranges

The smallest tidal ranges occur in the open ocean, and the largest occur in bays and rivers.
The riftscape itself does not really follow the tidal cycle, with entirely unpredictable ocean hights, dominated by the chaotic gyre spanning much of its area.
The tides near the riftscape are unpredictable, due to the influence of the gyre. 

Trader's Bay has especially large and difficult to predict tides due to the proximity of the riftscape coupled with the local geography. Typical tidal ranges are 20m-30m. 
The tides were smaller and more stable before the cataclysm, and as a consequence, the waterfront of both Easport and Haven has been substantially remodeled.
Kita Lau is relatively shielded from the influence of the rift due to the Shards of Xuon. Tidal ranges near smaller islands and convex coastlines are around 3m-10m, and 5m-15m near the bays.
The City of Bridges has a rather gentle tidal range of 3m.

Most of the outlying islands off the southeast coast of Eaos have gentle tides. Those of Enjat-Tehktun are larger and more chaotic due to the rift, between 5m-10m. Those of the Sachean Diarchy are 1.5m-3m.

Teythmos is at the mouth of a deep bay, giving it a rather large tidal range of 18m. The city itself is built at the top of a cliffside, well above high tide, with a series of boat lifts providing access to the Teythmos river.

The tides near the north pole are unusual - the extreeme northern lattidue coupled shape of northern Mhidda results in a tidal cycle that is dominated primarly by interactions between the ocean and the coasts.
The tides here are still on a roughly twice-daily cycle, but the times and magnitudes of high and low tide is much more varied.

The Dhagiean Isles experience a similar effect, although to a lesser degree. High tide is still consistently at noon and midnight, but tidal ranges have a much larger monthly variance then elsewhere on Dael.

## Wandering Stars:

Beyond the two suns and three moons, there are seven more well-defined celestial bodies. Their motions are less predictable, but still follow distict paths.
Some follow eliptical orbits, and some orbits are slightly off the axis of the celestial plane.

### Bright Wanderers

About the same size as the lesser spheres, but further away, such that they appear as large stars. Rather more erratic orbits than the lesser spheres.

Eternity - Iron.
Essence - Quicksilver.
Clarity - Diamond (Eter). Effectively invisible from Dael, even with a telescope.

### Dim Wanderers

Gas giants. Significantly larger than the other spheres, but also much further away.
Mostly distributed within the celestial dust, but still show motion relative to it.

Firenze - Nitrus-Sulfer-Aer gas giant. Red-orange.
Aqua - Agua-Sulpher-Dormis gas giant. Blue-orange.
Aeris - Nitrus-Aer-Dormis gas giant. Yellow.
Gaius - Agua-Calcus-Eter superplanet. Gray-green.

## Celestial Dust

Stars and Meteors

The celestial dust is made of shards of the other celestial spheres. 
From Dael, it looks like stars and nebulae, with the stairs primarly being composed of sunfire shards. These stares are given color by impurities, and by any dust their light passes through.
Over human timescales, the shards do not move relative to each other, and can be used for navigation. However, they are still mobile enough that significant drift can be observed over a thousand years or so.
While many cultures do identify constellations, these classifications are quite varied across both time and place, and rarely hold significant cultural significance. Certain individual stars demonstrate rather greater importance
due to their use in navigation - even with drift, bright stars are still quite valuable, especially those near the northern or southern extremes of the night sky.

Shards of other celestial bodies are largely invisible from Dael, but are the source of most (90%) meteorites that hit the planet(or any other celestial sphere). Such meteors generally occur when one of the Dim Wanders passes 
especially close to one of these shards and its gravity deflects it into the inner system, and gnerally have a varied composition, consisting of many different elements collected from many years bouncing around the celestial dust.

Secondary meteorites can be caused when a meteor from the celestial dust impacts one of the inner spheres. These are typically quite pure - mainly one material.
When these form from shards of the brightsun, they decay rapidly. If they manage to hit Dael before exiting the inner system, they will form a variety of exotic alloys and compounds upon impact, 
with whatever pure sunfire that remains dissipating rapidly. If they miss, they will dissipate before their orbit would bring them back to the inner spheres. These make up 3% of meteorites that hid Dael.
When these form from the shards of the darksun, they can last for a bit longer. If they do hid Dael, they impact with a fairly violent magical explosion, and also form a variety of alloys, 
but there will typically be some shards of darkstone left over as well. These make up 6% of meteorites that hid Dael.
Meteorites formed from shards of either of the three moons will simply be a large chunk of that respective metal, and upon impact can be found fused with the bottom of the impact crater. 
These make up the remaining 1% of meteorites, with gold being the most common and copper being the rarest. Bright wanderer shards technically fall in this category too, but are exceptionally rare - less than 0.1% of all meteorites.

Physics Note:
The materials that comprise the celestial spheres embody the known elements.

# Celestial Magic

Because each of the spheres is a pure material, their motions have significant effects on the tides of magic.

The Eaosian Wizards (centered in the AoMMA) are aware of this influence, and often make use of the power-amplifying effects of solar convergences. 
However, they are dismisive of the more subtler asspects, believing it a crutch to be used by hedgemages and sorcerers.

The Thal Wizards have cultivated a much deeper connection with the cosmos, and have comprehensively mapped its workings.
This synergises well with their penchant for group workings, where individual magic users can channel a single sphere.
The Thal are currently constructing a skyship to try and reach the heavens.
