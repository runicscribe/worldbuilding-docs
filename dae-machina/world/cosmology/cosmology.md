# World Cosmology

The system of Dae'machina is centered on the planet Terra Mendael (or Dael, as it is more commonly called).
The planet is orbited by various celestial bodies, each slightly larger than 1/10th of its diameter. These orbiting spheres are all uniform and lifeless.
At a distance greater than a few light-years from Dael, the fabric of spacetime frays into non-Euclidean folding that makes it seem as if you are moving without actually going anywhere. 
Parallel universes may exist, and pocket dimensions are possible (As demonstrated by parts of the Riftscape)

This geocentric structure gives a short solar year (1 week). This
(coupled with a neglegible axial tilt) means that there is no real seasonal climate
variation. Instead, the climate and the seasons are controlled by
elementals. Also, this means that there are no real lunar phases.
Additionally, since the sun is inside of the orbit of the moons, there
are no solar eclipses. However lunar eclipses, by Terra Mendael and by either sun, occur on roughly weekly intervals, with a pattern that changes throughout the year.
Eclipses from the suns only occur near the equator, as at more extreeme latitudes they merely pass by each other. Terra Mendael is large enough that eclipses caused by it are visible planet-wide. 
The major celestial bodies all manifest as some element on earth. Each
celestial shpere is comprised primarily of this material (plus
impurities, meteor impacts, oxidization, etc.). They are also covered with arcane geometric patterns.

Beyond the major celestial bodies there is a background of stars and celestial dust (comets, meteors, dust, sunfire fragments, gas, etc.)

## The Center - Terra Mendael 

The planet upon which all life exists.
9800 km in diameter/30787 km circumference (0.76911 the size of earth)
0.011 degrees/km at equator (85.5 km/degree)

Mass = 3.038e24 kg
Volume = 4.928e20 m3
Gravity is 8.445 m/s2

The planet spins counter to the spheres, with a period of 28.8 hours. Coupled with the rotation of the suns, this gives a 24 hour day, and a 6 day week.
The suns rise in the east, and set in the west.


## Great Spheres ("Suns")
The first of the celestial spheres are locked in identical opposing orbits, with an orbital period of 6 days.
This orbit is approx 1.113e8m m from the planet, resulting in a sky diameter of 30.9' for each of these spheres.

### Brightsun

Composed of "Sunfire", a fragile, transparent crystal. This crystal rapidly breaks down at low pressures (less than 1000 atm) or regions of low arcana, emmiting massive amounts of heat, light, and arcana. 
Due to this, it is extremely rare on Dael and seldom lasts for long.


### Darksun

Composed of "Darkstone", a brittle, opaque black crystal that excludes arcana and aether. This material is durable, but explodes violently if damaged, releasing a burst of arcana.
The Darksun excludes all light, and is only known about due to the lunar eclipses it causes.

### Auroras

Light, heat, and Arcana is constantly emitted by the Brightsun. 
Faint auroras sometimes occur in a band perpendicular to the line between the darksun and brightsun, where this energy passes through the atmosphere and then back into space.
These are most visible slightly after dusk and before dawn, and more visible the closer to either pole you go. Their intensity is affected by the lunar orbits.
In the mid-northern and mid-southern lattitudes, the direction of these bands is sometimes used to aid navigation.

## Lesser Spheres ("Moons")

The next three spheres occur in successive concentric orbits.
As with the two suns, all three have a diameter of 1000 km.
The three lesser spheres come into convergence every 252 days. The [Daes calender](./calender) is based upon this convergence.
This convergence coincides with a lunar eclipse by the Darksun. The exact time of convergence occurs near dusk over much of Eaos, and near dawn over much of Quon Xi. It is only visible from eastern Eaos and western Quon Xi.

### Aurum
Composed entirely of gold. Good Enchanting medium. 
Orbital period of 36 days. Orbits approx 3.676e8 m from the planet. Sky diameter of 9.4'.

### Argent
Composed entirely of silver. Disruptive to magic. 
Orbital period of 63 days. Orbits approx 5.339e8 m from the planet. Sky diameter of 6.4'.

### Alkyne
Composed entirely of copper. Imprints/stores magical signatures. 
Orbital period of 84 days. Orbits approx 6.468e8 m from the planet. Sky diameter of 5.3'.

## Wandering Stars:

Beyond the two suns and three moons, there are seven more well-defined celestial bodies. Their motions are less predictable, but still follow distict paths.
Some follow eliptical orbits, and some orbits are slightly off the axis of the celestial plane.

### Bright Wanderers

About the same size as the lesser spheres, but further away, such that they appear as large stars. Rather more erratic orbits than the lesser spheres.

Eternity - Iron.
Essence - Starmetal. Highly sensitive to magic, and will float in areas
of strong arcana. Responsible for the magical properties of meteoric
iron.
Clarity - Diamond

### Dim Wanderers

Gas giants. Significantly larger than the other spheres, but also much further away.
Mostly distributed within the celestial dust, but still show motion relative to it.

Firenze - Sulfer-Methane gas giant. Red-orange.
Aqua - Hydrogen-Oxygen gas giant. Blue-orange.
Aeris - Oxygen-Nitrogen gas giant. Yellow.
Gaius - Silicon-Carbon-Oxide superplanet. Gray-green.

## Celestial Dust

Stars and Meteors

The celestial dust is made of shards of the other celestial spheres. 
From Dael, it looks like stars and nebulae, with the stairs primarly being composed of sunfire shards. These stares are given color by impurities, and by any dust their light passes through.
Over human timescales, the shards do not move relative to each other, and can be used for navigation. However, they are still mobile enough that significant drift can be observed over a thousand years or so.
While many cultures do identify constellations, these classifications are quite varied across both time and place, and rarely hold significant cultural significance. Certain individual stars demonstrate rather greater importance
due to their use in navigation - even with drift, bright stars are still quite valuable, especially those near the northern or southern extremes of the night sky.

Shards of other celestial bodies are largely invisible from Dael, but are the source of most meteors that hit the planet(or any other celestial sphere). Such meteors generally occur when one of the Dim Wanders passes 
especially close to one of these shards and its gravity deflects it into the inner system.

Physics Note:
The materials that comprise the celestial spheres embody the known elements.

# Celestial Magic

Because each of the spheres is a pure material, their motions have significant effects on the tides of magic.

The Eaosian Wizards (centered in the AoMMA) are aware of this influence, and often make use of the power-amplifying effects of solar convergences. 
However, they are dismisive of the more subtler asspects, believing it a crutch to be used by hedgemages and sorcerers.

The Thal Wizards have cultivated a much deeper connection with the cosmos, and have comprehensively mapped its workings.
This synergises well with their penchant for group workings, where individual magic users can channel a single sphere.
The Thal are currently constructing a skyship to try and reach the heavens.
