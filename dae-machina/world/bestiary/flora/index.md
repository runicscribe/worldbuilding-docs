# Flora

Flora includes all members of the kingdom Vita. Members of this kingdom generate energy through photosynthesis, have no nervous system and are generally immobile. Fauna reproduce sexually or asexually using seeds or spores.

Vita consists of  four phyla:

## Fungi

Members of this phylum are fleshy, spore-producing plants that obtain sustenance from decomposing matter. They include lichen, molds, and mushrooms.

### Luminescent Mushrooms



## Mosses

Members of this phylum are small, leafy plants that grow in large clumps or mats. They do not produce flowers and reproduce via spores.

### Temple Moss

A luminescent most commonly found growing on ruins in the Riftscape. Its glow is produced by directly converting ambient magic into light.


## Conifers and Cycads

Members of this phylum are nonflowering plants that reproduce from seeds in cones. They have tough waxy leaves and vary in size from small shrubs to immense trees.

## Flowering Plants

Members of this phylum reproduce sexually by spreading pollen between flowers. These flowers then produce seeds, often in the form of fruits. They have broad leaves and include small flowers, shrubs, and deciduous trees.

### Mana Bloom

A three-petaled flower with a dark blue/blue-white patern. Each plant/stem has only a single flower.

Like mana crystals, mana blooms natuarally store magical energy, and can be use to empower spells in magically depleted regions.

### Fire Flower

A bright orange flower with a faint glow. Its nectar is a food source for fire flies.

### Stranglevine

A vine found in swamps, that constricts when touched. Traps animals, killing them through constriction, then feeds on nutrients released by their rotting bodies. 

### Bladegrass

A stiff, upright grass averaging two to four feet tall.
Its edges are supernatually sharp, to dissuade large herbivores from eating it.

### Runewood Tree

Gnarled willowey tree with tendril like branches and long, thin leaves. Leaves are natually a pale grey-green color, but react to any magical fields or auras by glowing with a color related to the inducing magical field.

The wood of this tree is magically inert, but extremely good at chanelling magic. For this reason, it is often used for magical staffs or wands. 
Touching an object with a runewood staff is magically equivalent to touching the object directly. Additionally, the wood cannot be directly affected by magical effects such as transmutation, channeling, etc. 
(Instead, such effects are dirrected to other objects touching the wood). While runewood cannot be effectively enchanted, if it is inset with enchanted metal sigils or similar, an enchantment 
(a comon example is a strengthening/force distribution enchantment) can be made to effect the surroundings of the entire runewood item.

### Ironwood Tree
