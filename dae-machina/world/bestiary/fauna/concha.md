# Concha

# Morphologies

## Leviathans

6 segments, each with a pair of limbs. Crustacean-like. Generally breath through gills and are amphibuous

Includes a wide variety of creatures, such as living islands and shorecombers

### Cratcha

2 - 4 clawed forelims, with the remaining limbs forming legs (thoough the last pair or two may be more fin-like)
Generally ampphibuous scavengers.



#### Sidecrawler
A wide, flat crab whose body can grow up to two meters wide. Typically remains on the shoreline, scavenging food washed up by the waves.
As its name suggests, moves sideways.
Not very smart, and generally not hostile to Ael. A basic food lure can be used to direct its movements, which makes adult Sidecrawlers suitible for transporting small loads.

#### Riftclaw

All twelve limbs end in smalish claws, making this a very effective climber.
Otherwise, has a somewhat variable morphology that differs from other Cratcha in unusual ways. Not known to exist prior to the cataclysm
Many subspecies, varying in size from 10 cm to 8 m wide.

Some have been found to be tameable

#### Shore Stalker

Ambush predator. Buries itself in sand just below the waterline
Strong and fast for its size. Sometimes used to pull carts, typically through an incentive of fresh fish

#### Greater Shorecomber

Large crab-like creature that dwells around coastlines, scavenging just about anything that has washed ashore.
About as tall as it is wide. 
Slow-moving, and fairly consistently remains partway above water, so animals (and sometimes Ael) often build homes atop its shell. 

#### Sea Strider

Long, double-jointed legs. Air bladders in its body allow it to float. Legs are covered in venomous spines and end in claws. Feeds by catching prey in these spines, similar to jellyfish, though on a rather larger scale.
Can grow up to 50 m tall.

### Living Island

Pointed snout with two antenae and six feathery tentacles that are used to trap krill, jellyfish, and small fish.
Two pairs of black eyes under brow ridge
Head widens into a large body segment, with large gills on the underside and a tall peak. Sybsequent segments are tapered, each smaller than the last. Each segment has a pair of finned segmented legs.

Float along the surface of the water collecting food in their tentacles
Upper half of body segments consist primarly of a large gas bladder which keeps them afloat. 


## Krinids

Long, flexible, multi-segmented body.
Various limb configurations - some have many many legs, others have one or two clusters at different points of body.


## Ossagers

Multisegmented body (between four and six segments, sometimes fused), eight legs.
Includes armored bicorn.

### Armord Bicorn

Large herbivore, about the size and shape of a rhino.
Found across Eaosian grasslands, and eastern edge of the Great Eaos desert.

8 legs, with thick, blunt feet No joits below the elbow - the entire lower leg is a single fused mass of armored carapace.

Head has a wide, flat horn extending from the center, which splits into two halfway along its length 

Legs let it turn over earth and dug for roots and tubers.


Some have been semi-domesticate, and are used to clear ground for fresh cropland.

## Seraphim

3-segmented body - head, thorax, abdomen
6 limbs developed as wings - often fused, plus 6 legs
All limbs connect to the center body segment.

Includes Kiteflys, seraphim moths, ...

### Seraphim Moth

Large, six-winged moth.


## Fespers

4-segmented body:
Head, segment with 4 legs, segment with 4 wings (or more commonly, a pair of elytra and a pair of wings), abdomen

Includes fireflys and carrion bees.

### Fire Fly

Small, glowing red insects.
Immune to heat. Naturally generates an incendiary aura. Has a tendancy to ignite swamp gasses.

### Carrion Bees

Also known as Red Honeybees or Bloodhoney Bees, these instects form large hives and have a particularly potent sting.
If something damages their hive in an attempt to raid it for their honey, they will attack, usually stinging it to death.
Their unique venom will reanimate the corpse as a zombie, within which they will rebuild their hive.
They still primarily subsist on necter and pollen, but will also leech nutrients from any corpse their hive occupies.

When this corpse eventually breaks down, the hive will remain where it fell, until it is attacked again.

Primarily infests bears and badgers.
Particularly large hives may accumulate multiple zombified corpses into some sort of flesh collosus.

These insects are prized both for their honey, which is like regular honey but with a much higher protein content (although only when harvested from hives currently occupying a corpse), and their venom,
which is much sought-after by novice necromancers.

### Hive Swarm

Insect colonies that have developed telepathy and manifested a true hive mind
A few subspecies - mostly small colony insects, but one of larger bugs.
