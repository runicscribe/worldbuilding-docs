6 limbs developed as wings - often fused, plus 6 legs
All limbs connect to the center body segment.

Includes Kiteflys, seraphim moths, ...


## Krinids

Long, flexible, multi-segmented body.
Various limb configurations - some have many many legs, others have one or two clusters at different points of body.


## Ossagers

Multisegmented body (between four and six segments, sometimes fused), eight legs.
Includes armored bicorn.

## Fespers

4-segmented body:
Head, segment with 4 legs, segment with 4 wings (or more commonly, a pair of elytra and a pair of wings), abdomen

Includes fireflys and carrion bees.

# Species

## Armord Bicorn

Large herbivore, about the size and shape of a rhino.
Found across Eaosian grasslands, and eastern edge of the Great Eaos desert.

8 legs, with thick, blunt feet No joits below the elbow - the entire lower leg is a single fused mass of armored carapace.

Head has a wide, flat horn extending from the center, which splits into two halfway along its length 

Legs let it turn over earth and dug for roots and tubers.


Some have been semi-domesticate, and are used to clear ground for fresh cropland.

## Greater Shorecomber

Large crab-like creature that dwells around coastlines, scavenging just about anything that has washed ashore.
Slow-moving, and fairly consistently remains partway above water, so animals (and sometimes Ael) often build homes atop its shell. 

## Living Island

Pointed snout with two antenae and six feathery tentacles that are used to trap krill, jellyfish, and small fish.
Two pairs of black eyes under brow ridge
Head widens into a large body segment, with large gills on the underside and a tall peak. Sybsequent segments are tapered, each smaller than the last. Each segment has a pair of finned segmented legs.

Float along the surface of the water collecting food in their tentacles
Upper half of body segments consist primarly of a large gas bladder which keeps them afloat. 

## Fire Fly

Small, glowing red insects.
Immune to heat. Naturally generates an incendiary aura. Has a tendancy to ignite swamp gasses.

## Carrion Bees

Also known as Red Honeybees or Bloodhoney Bees, these instects form large hives and have a particularly potent sting.
If something damages their hive in an attempt to raid it for their honey, they will attack, usually stinging it to death.
Their unique venom will reanimate the corpse as a zombie, within which they will rebuild their hive.
They still primarily subsist on necter and pollen, but will also leech nutrients from any corpse their hive occupies.

When this corpse eventually breaks down, the hive will remain where it fell, until it is attacked again.

Primarily infests bears and badgers.
Particularly large hives may accumulate multiple zombified corpses into some sort of flesh collosus.

These insects are prized both for their honey, which is like regular honey but with a much higher protein content (although only when harvested from hives currently occupying a corpse), and their venom,
which is much sought-after by novice necromancers.

## Hive Swarm

Insect colonies that have developed telepathy and manifested a true hive mind
A few subspecies - mostly small colony insects, but one of larger bugs.

# Seraphim Moth
