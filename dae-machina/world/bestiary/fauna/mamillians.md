#### Spirit Wolf

Large grey wolf found in Mhidda and northern Eaos.
Dead pack members frequently remain as ghosts, and while they can't do much more in this form than howl or mildly chill anything they pass throug, this is still enough to help on hunts.
During colder weather, these ghosts are also able to concentrate the cold in themselves, helping the libing pack members retain body heat.

Found across central and northern Mhidda
In the northernmost reagions of Mhidda, there are some Spirit wolf packs which consist solely of ghosts, sometimes with the occaisional Ice Fury.

#### Amalgam Wolf

Fur coloration is a mix of red and dark grey.
Unusual shapeshifting ability - packmembers can merge togather to form a larger wolf, or split appart to form smaller wolves, similar to slimes.
When merging, the result averages the features of the constituent individuals, but when splitting, the result are just a smaller version of the large form.
This process also occasionally introduces errors like duplicate or missing organs, reduced fertillity, or oddly textured fur.
This has had negative impacts on the species' biodiversity.

Amalgam Wolves usually take advantage of their size to hunt large Concha and Mamillians like Juggernauts, Shorecombers, or Rho'thu, 
but when food is scarce will split into smaller forms and spread out, preying on whatever is available.

Originated in the Riftscape.
Found throught Kita Lau and the Riftscape, and on the west coast of Eaos.
