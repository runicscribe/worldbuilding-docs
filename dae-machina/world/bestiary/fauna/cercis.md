## Wurms

*Cercis Crinis Vermis*

Wurms are large subteranean or aquatic omnivores, with a long, segmented body.

Wurms typically have quadrilateral symitry, although trilateral and pentalateral variants exist. Their body is comprised of rows of armored plates, used for protection and locomotion.
Their head has four larger mandible plates, lined with toothlike ridges. Where these plates meet the body, there is a sensory bundle consisting of 3 primitive photoreceptors (four total - one at each junction)
There is also a smaller set of mandible plates just forward each sensor bundle, and four spiked tonge-tentacles inside of the wurms mouth.

The opposite end of the wurm tapers to point. About once per hear, the wurm gains another row of plates along its body, slightly larger than the last. 
Mandible plates are the only plates that actually grow over time (and can regrow if lost). The armor plates at the very end of the wurms tail are the same ones it had when it was a juvenile. 

Some are ambush predators, lurking just beneath the ground and swallowing anything that walks above them. Others are more like filter feeders, constantly moving and eating any food that finds its way into their mouth



### Swampwurms

Swampwurms are relatively small compared to other wurm species, rarely exceeding 2 feet in diameter / 30 feet long.
They are amphibuious, swimming through the mud and water of the swamp.
Swampwurms can survive on the plant and insect life within the soil of the swamp, but will eat larger animals if they get the chance.

### Desert Wurm

Desert wurms are the rarest subspecies of wurm on account of the low food supply, and generally inhabit the edges if tbe Eos wastes rather thant the center. They are a significant contributor to the spread of the desert, 
by destroying root systems of vegetation near its edges. They move by burrowning through the sand.

Desert Wurms are considered adult once it reaches 40-50 years, but they can live almost indefinately.

Desert wurms mostly see through sounds and vibrations transmitted through the sands, but their sensory bundles do give them the ability to detect light and mobement.
They primarily prey on burrowing animals in their dens, and on any herd animals that venture into their territory. 

### Ocean Wurms

## Jellies

*Cercis Gelata*

### Floating Jellyfish

Various sizes and variants, including luminescent.

### Stone Jellies

Also known as: Floating colonies, helium barnacles, stinging riftrocks.

A floating jellyfish variant most common to riftscape.
Born in ocean. Juvenile form resembles a small aquatic jellyfish.
Adult stage floats out of the water and anchors itself to the underside of the first rock it lands on - typically rift shards, although outside of the riftscape they can be found on seacliffs and coastal arches.
Grow sillicate shell, taking the apperance of a large barnacle, with long, hanging tendrils.
Adults tend to accumulate into large colonies, and feed by extending their stinging tentacles into water and snaring passing sealife

When reproducing, they drop their spawn into the ocean below, where currents carry it to new locations.

Because they are found on the underside of rock formations outside the water, very few things are able to prey on them.
Adults start fairly large, with tendrils extending several meters (necessary to reach the ocean below), and grow over time.
A large colony can consist of thousands of individuals, covering dozens of square meters, with tendrils up to fifty meters long, and be capable of consuming larger fish and seabirds, or even overly curios Aeldar.
