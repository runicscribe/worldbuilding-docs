# Fauna

Fauna comprise the kingdom Anima. Members of this kingdom have some form of nervous system and are generally mobile. They gain energy by consuming other organisms.
Anima consists of three phyla:

## Cercis (Jellies)
Members of this phylum are radialy symmetric, and have a simple, redundant internal structure.
This phylum includes jellyfish, squids and krakens, and wurms.

## Concha (Shells)
Members of concha are supported by an external skeleton and generally have a simple nervous system.
This phylum includes insects and similar.

## Spina (Vertebrates)
Members of this phylum have a central spinal column, an internal skeleton, and are bilaterally symmetric. Members of Spina generally have a relatively complex physiology.
This phylums includes serpentfish, hexapedes, longfeather birds, raptors, and mamillians.

### Serpentfish
4-6 eyes, long flexible body. Mostly cartiligious skeleton.
Typically have 2 pairs of lateral fins, one dorsal fin, one or two belly fins, and a large vertical tail fin.
Strictly aquatic, breath via gills

### Hexapedes.

Six limbs, bony skeleton, serpentine body, scaly skin. Oviporous.
Includes dragons, cliffrunner lizards.


### Longfether Birds

Feathered birds with long tails.
Skeletal structure shows vestigial limb bones in these tails, giving them superiour maneuverability.
Wings may or may not include clawed fingers.
Mostly omnivorous. Bony, toothed beak


### Raptors [?]

Feathered birds with short, blunt tails, and a true beak without teeth.
Skeleton shows only four limbs (wings + legs)


### Mamillians

Four limbs, furred, live birth.
Strictly terrestrial - there are no flight-capable mamillians
Ungulates, Carnivores, and Hominids

In addition to these three phyla, there are two additional classifications not associated with a phylum.

## Chimeras

Magical created created by combining existing creatures. 
Have a relatively natural biologies. Some chimeras are fertile and have their own established species, others are unique and/or infertile. Manticores are one example of an established chimera species

## Abberations

Creatures created by purely magical means. The archetypical example is oozes.

Notes:

No horses (on Eos only? perhaps on Zhal continent)
No rodents - pest species are mostly insects, with some lizards and jellies.
