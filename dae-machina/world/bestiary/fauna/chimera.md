Long, wide tail, with a toothed maw at the end. Primarly uses this tail to ambush and devour prey, rather than its natural head.

Furred and feathered variants exist.

### Rift Dregs

Inadvertently created during the Uon cataclysm, Dregs are amophous amalgams of flora, fauna, and innanimate material. Some consider them to abberations instead of Chimera.
There is a fixed numbe of dregs, and they cannot reproduce, but there are enough of them to be considered an established variant. 
Dregs are solely found in the vicinity of the Riftscape. They are omnivorous, and universally hostile to all other forms of life. Many can also feed via photosynthesis.
Dregs usually operate on the scrambled base instincts of their contingent forms, retaining just enough of a mind to find food and avoid cliff edges, although a rare few are more intelligent.

## Unique Chimera Variants

### Belly of the beasts

Vaguely like a troll with goat horns, and slightly longer back legs, and significantly larger.
Hollow cavity full of heads of various creatures where its belly should be.
