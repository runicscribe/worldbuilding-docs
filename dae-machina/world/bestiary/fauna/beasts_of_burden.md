# Beasts of Burden

No horses (on Eos only? perhaps on Zhal continent)


Rho'thu - used as a plowbeast, beast of burden, and occasinally a warbeast across Eaos.
Fairly slow, but very strong.

Clifrunner lizards used as a mount and to carry small loads throughout southwest Eaos, Kita Lau, and the Riftscape.

No real fast cavalry suitable for mounted combat or fast transport. The only way to get somewhere faster than walking is magic or boats.
(Although beasts of burden can make travel more comfortable, just not notably faster)

Along the Southwest coast of Eaos, large Floating Jellyfish may be tied to Rho'thu or sailing ships to transport, large, heavy loads across long distances (albeit very slowly)

Juggernaughts may be used for transport or war, but are too large and destructuve to make effective farm animals.

A few different types of goat are used by the midh as all-purpose farm animals, and occasionally for transport. They are not large enough to use as mounts, and genrally not tame enough to be good for pulling plows.
Dogsleds are used for transport in the far north.

Yaks and llamas used for farming and transport in Quon Xi.

Among the fae, if large loads needed to be moved, shifted or direbeasts do the work. Since they can shapeshift, they can move faster than most other Ael who cannot take advantage of magic to travel faster.

The 'jinn usually rely on magic for transport

The Elyos Republic has a functioning teleporter network conecting several of their major cities. This is primarly used to transport people, and valuable non-magical goods.
