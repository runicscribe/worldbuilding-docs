# Beasts of Burden

Rho'thu are used as a plowbeast, beast of burden, and occasinally a warbeast across Eaos. They are fairly slow, but very strong.
Armored Bicorns are used in a similar role, though most often for transport or war, as they are generally , too large and destructuve to make effective farm animals (though there has been some success in using them to clear land).

Along the Southwest coast of Eaos, large Floating Jellyfish may be tied to Shorecomber Crabs or sailing ships to transport large, heavy loads across long distances (albeit very slowly)

Smaller crustaceans like riftclaws, surf stalkers, and sidecrawlers are used as mid-weight transports across coastal Eaos.

Clifrunner lizards used as a mount and to carry small loads throughout Kita Lau, the Riftscape, and some parts of southwest Eaos. 

All of these creatures have fairly low long-distance travelling speeds. The only way to get somewhere faster than walking is magic or boats.
These beasts of burden can make travel more comfortable, just not notably faster.

A few different types of goat are used by the midh as all-purpose farm animals, and occasionally for transport. They are not large enough to use as mounts, and genrally not tame enough to be good for pulling plows.
Dogsleds are used for transport in the far north.

Some Hyenid Eaos Fae use zombies (humanoid or otherwise) as packbeasts.


Among most Eaosian fae, if large loads needed to be moved, shifted or direbeasts often do much of the work. Since they can shapeshift, they can move faster than most other Ael who cannot take advantage of magic to travel faster.

The 'jinn usually rely on magic for transport

The Elyos Republic has a functioning teleporter network conecting several of their major cities. This is primarly used to transport people, and valuable non-magical goods.

Yaks and llamas used for farming and transport in Quon Xi.
