# Abberations

Abberations are autonomous creatures created by purely magical means, by a deliberate act of magic
They differ from Chimeras and Undead in that their creation does not involve other creatures.
They differ from elementals in that they are not created magically.
They differ from constructs in that they are autonomous, and capable of reproduction.

Artificially creating life is exceptionally difficult and rather dangerous, so abberations are relatively rare. This is somewhat balanced by the fact that the few successes 
tend to be quite resilient and capable of thriving in adverse conditions.

They vary wildly in appearance and ability. Some may behave more like flora than fauna, although all are categorized as fauna for convenience.

As with constructs/automatons, no known sapient abberations exist.

## Oozes

Oozes Archetypical example of an abberation, and the most common.
Their body consists of homogenous biomagical fluid, which usually viscous and acidic.
Within these parameters, their shape and size can vary greatly.
Oozes consume (primarly) organic matter to gain mass, and reproduce by splitting once they get to a certain size.
The majority of oozes are found in the swamps south of the free cities and across the riftscape.

Most oozes percieve their surroundings solely through touch, although some have magical senses that allow them to also detect nearby prey.

Because of their relative simplicity, Oozes have been independantly on several occasions, and as such many different lineages exist.

### Common Ooze

Thick jelly-like consistency, ovoid shape. Ranges from 10 - 100 cm in diameter.
Mildly resistant to magic.  Not soluble in water.
Mostly harmless - mildly acidic, but not so much that its especially dangerous to most creatures.
Primarly eats dead biomass - animal or vegetable. Color reflects its diet.
Fairly active - constantly moving in some direction, turning if it hits a wall.
Also capable of neutralizing most volatile chemicals.
Non-flammable, unless it has recently ingested a lot of flammable matter.

Origins lost to time, but likely created to clean up a mage's laboratory.
These days, frequently infests sewers.

Can repair moderate damage, but cannot reform after being splattered over a wide area.
Can be destroyed by extreme heat (greater than 200 C).
If trapped in a place without food, will eventually consume itself and die.

### Swamp Ooze

Looks like an orange or green-hued irregular mass of slime.
Dynamic control over its own shape - can spread itself over a wide region or throught a body of water then quickly pull itself back together.
Sticky and elastic - can easily climb walls and trees, and can vary how sticky broad regions of their body is.
Can dangle tendrils below it. Not prehensile, but can retract quickly, or be used to pull the rest of the ooze towards them.

Not acidic by default, but after capturing prey with their sticky body, they will envelop it and secrete a potent acid, which is capable of dissolving small animals over the course of several minutes, and larger animals
like deer or humans over a coupple hours.

Swamp Oozes are so named because of their mosy common habitat, where food is plentiful and they easily blend in with the surrondings.
They are an active ambush predator, that requires a relatively large amount of prey to sustin itself, relative to other oozes.
When food is plentiful, they can grow quite large, with no real upper limit - only realy ever splits into multiple oozes through trauma or mishap, and even then will sometimes reform into a larger organizm.
When prey is scarce, they are cabably of maintaining their body (although not growing) by eating decaying vegetable matter in swamps and rainforests.
Less bountiful biomes cannot sustain them in this way, and they will fairly rapidly canabalize their own body mass for fuel.

Very difficult to kill while in their natual habitat, mainly because the terain makes seeing their whole body virtually impossible, and they will actively retreat if they are seriously injured.
Vulnerable to some chemicals, especially strong alkalis, magic, and cold.



### Necromantic Ooze

Created by one of the Lich-lords of old Eos as a bioweapon.

Dissolvles flesh and replaces with its own mass, animating bones to serve as a more mobile framework.

Normally looks like an oily grey puddle of liquid. 
Becomes a translucent pinkish-grey after consuming something.
Becomes a thick black oil when dehydrated, e.g. if it has sat inert for a few hundred years. Can persist in this form indefinately.


Quite dangerous. but fairly easy to deal with if you know you might be facing it.
Not particularly active without a body - mostly sits arround as a puddle as until something steps in it.
Only capable of animating vertebrates - can consume other fauna but not animate them. Incapable of consiming vegetable matter.
Can be destroyed through extreme dilution (~100 to 1), fire, or magic.

## Shoggoth

Animate mass of mutable flesh.
Consumes living things, and can replicate organs of anything it has eaten.
Alters its form to adapt to the situation - growing limbs, eyes, mouths, gills, etc. as needed.
