# Cambions (Elemental Possesion)

Cambions are elementals that are actively posessing a living being. They are almost exclusively daemons (emotion elementals), and mainly posess Aeldar.

Cambions retain all the magical powers of the elemental, and grant their host enhanced phisical abilites. However, they are still constrained to the physical form of their host.
Cambions also tend to subconciously produce illusions to alter their apperance. 

Weaker cambions are usually temporary, and may manifest as psychological disorders. Stronger cambions tend to be a force to be reckoned with, and may persist for several centuries.
Powerfull Cambions are immune to aging.

Cambions are relatively rare. Cambions sometimes originate from cults that tried to summon and bind an elemental in a bid for easy power, and failed the binding part.
