# Tools of the Art

Most magic users rely on some number of tools to make magic use easier. All mage tools are effectively an expression of the three Arcane schools of magic - [encantation](./schools/encantation), 
[sympathy](./schools/sympathy), and [enchanting](./schools/enchanting).

Differentiated from conventional sympathetic focci in that tools are general purpose, rather than focci which tend to be more specific

## Sympathetic Focci

Sympathy can also be used to reduce the arcana required by a spell by using a sympathetic focus of a material related to the effect of the spell.
Such focci can be considered one of the simplest forms of mage tool. They tend to be specialized to a single spell or type of spell, unlike other mage tools which are more generalized.
However, magic users that rely on a single type of magic, such as elementalists, may use sympathetic focci as their primary mage tools.
