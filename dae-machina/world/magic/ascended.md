# Ascended

"Asceded" is a broad category encompassing all entities who have become effectively immortal through magical means. While relativley rare - around one new Ascended shows up in the world each Aldar generation - 
their immortallity means they tend to accumulate.

The power of any given ascended varies greatly. Some (Especially ancient Aeldar) are extraordanally powerfull and capable of large-scale reality manipulation. Other's aren't even capable of taking actions on their own, 
and can only influence others (many ensouled object and spirit ascended fall into this category). Most are merely very powerfull, immortal, magic users.

A sufficiently powerfull Enchanter / Nullmage is often capable of killing the weakest of Ascended. Any stronger Ascended are extraordinarily difficult to kill, requiring the cooperation of many magic users or other Ascended. 
Multiform ascended in particular are especially tenacious.

After the lich wars of the middle Aeldar, Easoian ascended generally became less overt in their actions, so as to avoid another large-scale purge. Most now work from the shadows, or conduct their buisness in isolation.

Broadly speaking, all ascended become immortal by copying or binding their soul to an object or place. The more powerfull or magically inclined can also rewrite or copy their soul on the fly to jump between hosts.

Revenants and Spirits and other involuntary undead: Some undead, both spontaneous and created retain the full conciousness they had in life. These are not considered Ascended, as they have no control over how they bound 
to immortality. However, some of these may become true Ascended later in undeath.

Types:

- Necromancers 
-- Liches - Ascended who have bound their soul into their own undead body. One of the easier paths towards ascension (though still quite difficult), with the main downside of being repulsive to living people.

- Animancers
-- Ensouled objects - Ascended who have bound their soul into an object; a weapon, book, piece of jewelery, or similar. Such ascended most commonly come about as a last resort of wizards in an unwinable situation, 
   and are usually relatively weak, only capable of influencing whomever posseses the object. If they remain in the possiesion of a single person long enough, they are usually able to take over that person entirely, 
   and eventually construct a more powerfull form.
-- Spirits (rare) - Ascended who have bound themselves to a location, or the Aether itself. They tend to be weak, and fragile, but entirely unconstrained by physical limitations (althogh those bound to a location are 
   constrained to remain in that location).

- Artificers
-- Shells - Artificiers that work with null shells occasionally become skilled enough to fully transfer their soul to into their consturcts. This results in an Ascended 
   who is a magically animated construct (or spread accross many such constructs).

- Shapeshifters 
-- Shapeshifters capable of distributing their conciousness across multimple bodies become inherently immortal, as if any one body the others retain enough power and consciousness to form another body to replace it. 
   Insects are a paticularily popular choice for such multiform shapeshifters. Due to their distributed conciousness, most multiform shapeshifters are at least somewhat mentally unstable. 
-- More powerfull elemental shapeshifters can retain an elemental form indefinatley. This form does not age, and is inherently unkillable, although it may be destroyed under exceptional circumstances.

- Dragons
-- Dragons are inherently long lived, and exceptionally powerfull magic users. Any dragon that tries to become ascended through one of the above methods usually succeeds.

## Unbound Ascended

Most paths to ascension come with some limitations. These can include:
 - Being constrained to an object, place, or physical form
 - Being limited to a single body, still at risk of destruction
 - Being limited in the amount of power one can exert upon the world
 - A slow degredation of consciousness steming from a lack of physicality

Some rare ascended manage to exceed all these limits, acheiving true immortality and godlike power.
Such individuals are known as unbound ascended. Known unbound ascended include:

 - Queen of Ravens
 - Ael'syi Council
