# Chimerism

Chimerism, also known as biomagic, is the discipline of creating new forms of creatures.
Practitioners are known as Chimerists.

Chimerism has some overlap with shapeshifting, but while shapeshifters typically alter themselves into some other existing creature, 
chimerists typically reshape other creatures into never-before seen forms. That being said, many chimerists do also alter themselves, albiet in a somewhat patchwork manner.

Chimerism can also overlap with necromrancy, as the creatures used as raw materials aren't always alive.

Most chimera and abberations are the creations of chimerists.
