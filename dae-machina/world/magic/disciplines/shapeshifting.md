# Shapeshifting

Shapeshifting is the transformation of ones body into a different form. Mages specializing in Shapeshifting are referred to as Shapeshifters or Arcane Shapeshifters (to differentiate them from natural shapeshifters). 
Shapeshifting uses transmutation and sympathy, and sometimes Animancy and Telepathy.

Shapeshifters are split fairly evenly among learned and instinctive shapeshifters (Not counting the ‘fae and other natural shapeshifters). 
Learned shapeshifters are generally capable of taking more forms then instinctive shapeshifters, as well as being more skilled at taking partial forms. 
Shapeshifters who specialize in simple alterations to their appearance, or other forms of human-to-human shapeshifting are generally learned shapeshifters. 
Instinctive shapeshifters tend to have a better mastery of a single animal form, including a better control over the instincts of their alternate form, 
and the ability to shift between forms faster than most learned shapeshifters. Inexperienced instinctive shapshifters require an animal totem to shapeshift, 
but most experienced instinctive shapeshifters are capable of shapeshifting without a totem. Most learned shapeshifters always require a totem to shapeshift.

Mages who shapeshift frequently age at about half the rate they would age naturally.
 



Transmutation can also be used to alter the form of living things other than oneself. This is generally more difficult than shapeshifting. Many High Fae and other powerfull learned shapeshifters are skilled at this, 
and have created a number of magical creatures that still inhabit the land, including Oozes and Chimera.

## Cosmetic Shapeshifting

The simplest form of shapeshifting is altering one’s surface appearance as a form of disguise. 
This could be as simple as changing the length and color of ones hair, or as complex as completely changing one’s face and body shape. 
With this form of shapeshifting, ones internal biology doesn't change, just external features. It only requires use of transmutation, although sympathy may be used if the mage is disguising themselves as a specific person.

## Physical Shapeshifting

Another form of shapeshifting is transforming into an animal or other species (although technically, the technique also works for transforming completely into another individual of the same species).

Because of the complexity of the transmutation involved, this almost always requires some part of the animal in question to act as a sympathetic focus, usually referred to a totem.
Shapeshifters who shift to and from one specific form often may eventually be able to shapeshift without a totem.
For forms whose biology differs notably from the mage's natural form, animancy and telepathy is used to keep their mind intact atop the form's biology. 
Skipping this step is a good way for a mage to wind up stuck in animal form forever, with their mind rapidly becoming just like any other animal. Even when using this process, the form's natural though paterns will leak through
somewhat, and shapesifting into an animal usually causes the shapeshifter do gain many of the instincts of that animal. This is usually a good thing, as it makes adjusting to the new form a lot easier.

Because physical shapeshifting is an imensely complex process facilitated primarly though sympathy, only a mages phisical body is included in the transformation, not anything worn or caried.
Skilled mages can use a variety of means to conjure clothes or the semblance of clothes upon returning to their natural form, to get around this downside. This is mostly only done by already skilled mages who learn shifting later in life.
Mages who learn shapeshifting early in their studies typically become so used to nudity that by the time they become skilled enough to conjure clothes, they often don't find it worth the effort, except in extreme need.
Furthermore, many shapeshifters (most notably the 'fae) are natural shapeshifters who were born with the abilitiy to transform and never wind up studing such magics.

### Partial Shapeshifting

Another type of shapeshifting is partial shapeshifting, where the shapeshifter only transforms part of their body, or forms a shape halfway between their natural form and the form of another animal. 
This requires more skill and control than conventional animal shapeshifting, but is still much easier than sizechanging or multiform or elemental shapeshifting.

A more advanced varient of this is chimeric shapeshifting, where a mage combines partial transformations from many different sources, resulting in a mix of different body parts.

### Sizechanging

Because transmutation magic only changes the shape of something and obeys conservation of mass, animal forms that are similar in size to the shapeshifter are preferred. 
However, this constraint can be bypassed in a couple of ways:

By adding in evocation magic to make up the difference of mass, a shapeshifter can shift to differently sized form. However, using evocation to significantly increase one's size requires a lot of magical power. 
This means that shifting into a larger form through this method is very difficult, and returning to human form after using this method to shift to a smaller form is likewise difficult.

One way of avoiding the power requirments for larger forms is called skinwalking. This process uses the freshly slain corpse of the target shape as a totem, merging ones body with it through the course of the tranmutation,
and discarding the excess mass when shifting back. It is rather visceral and only practiced by small number of shamans.

The other way of shifting to a differently sized form is using what is effectively a more complex form of cosmetic shapeshifting, where a mage shifts just their surface appearnce to mimic the target form while staying the same 
mass, reshaping any internal biology in whatever ways are needed to make this work. Because this results in biology that is almost entirely unlike that of the target form, a sympathetic totem provides very little help. 
Consequently, this method is much more technically challenging than making up the difference in mass with evocation, even though it requires much less power. It is also better suited to forms smaller than the mage's natural form, 
as the decrease in density that would result in shifting to a larger form would make such a form physically frail. One other benefit of this approach is that returning to one's natural form is always relatively easy.


#### Draconic Shapeshifting

Dragons are the most common practitioners of sizechanging, often using it to transform into Ael or Ael-like forms so they can walk among the Ael more convenionently. Most dragons use the second method, giving them forms that are
exceptionally strong and dense. This approach also allows them to retain their full reserves of magical power, and lets them shift back to their natural form in a matter of seconds making a dragon in Ael-form 
basically as powerfull as a dragon in their natural form. This does make it fairly easy to identify shifted dragons, by magical or even mundane means (e.g. observing footprint depth).

Some dragons who wish to remain undetected will use the first method. This carries significant risk, because shifting fully into Ael-form eliminates all their physical advantages, and limits the amount of Arcana they can hold onto.
Furthermore, the large size difference means they need an immense ammount of magical power to shift back to draconic form, so if they are taken by surprise it could be deadly. However, they do still retain their formidible knowledge,
experience, and magical skill in when shifted, so even though they are weaker, they are still not to be trifled with. 


## Elemental Shapeshifting and Multiform Shapeshifting

The most difficult types of shapeshifting are multiform shapeshifting and elemental shapeshifting. With either of these types of shapeshifting, the shapeshifter must use animancy to fully preserve their mind and essence, 
as they do not have a proper body to reside in. Consequently, these types of shapeshifting are limited to very powerful mages, liches, and other immortals, who are already capable of preserving their soul outside of their 
natural body (although it should be noted that most elemental or multiform shapeshifters are necessarily immortal, due to the fact that they must be capable of preserving their soul outside of their natural body).

With multiform shapeshifting, the shapeshifter splits into numerous small animals, such as a swarm or rats or a flock of birds. The shapeshifter has some degree of control over each of these creatures.
With elemental shapeshifting, the shapeshifter transforms their body into some inorganic substance, such as stone, fire, water or smoke, but are still able to move, use magic, and communicate.

The Queen of Ravens is a (incredibly powerful) multiform shapeshifter (at this point, its a matter of debate as to whether or not numerous bodies should be considered a magical bloodline all their own). 
The Æl’jinn are a magical bloodline of elemental shapeshifters (and in fact are the only magical bloodline of elemental shapeshifters that exists).


## Shapeshifter Bloodlines

Because the shifted form of a shapeshifter is effectively a magical construct, if a **shifted shapeshifter** mates with an animal that shares their form, 
there is a relatively high chance that the offspring will be an Arcane Savant with some form of shapeshifting talent. This is much more likely if the shapeshifter is using natural shapeshifting abilities from a magical bloodline.

- Direbeasts are animals with a human level of intelligence. They are the progeny of animal shapeshifters (most often fae), but do not have the ability to shapeshift. While they have a human level of intelligence, 
  they are limited to animal means of communication, which means that they can have difficulty communicating with non-fae Ael.
- Natural shapeshifters are any beings (animal or human) that have the inherent ability to take another form. Before the 'fae became common, they were most often the offspring of arcane shapeshifters, but in modern times, 
  the majority of Natural Shapeshifters are the progeny of 'fae. While arcane shapeshifters can generally take multiple forms, natural shapeshifters are usually limited to two forms, 
  based on the true form of each of their parents

The probability of certain results for such pairings are described in the following table:
 
|                      | Natural Shapeshifter                            | Arcane Shapeshifter                         | Direbeast                                       | Natural Animal                              |

The most dramatic example of this phenomena is the AEl’jinn, who have become a race of natural shapeshifters over the course of several centuries.


Even if the shapeshifter is in their natural form, there is still a possibility that their offspring will be natural shapeshifters. 
This phenomena is responsible for the formation of Æl‘jinn bloodline (since they have no reproductive biology in their elemental form). 
The probability of certain results for such pairings are described in the following table:

\* Includes 'Mundane' descendants of natural shapeshifters.
\*\* Includes humans
 
There are a few more recent groups of natural shapeshifters descended from groups powerful arcane shapeshifters and unrelated to the 'fae. Based on how natural shapeshifting abilities form in shapeshifter populations, 
it takes about 100-200 years for a group of (rather prolific) arcane shapshifters to become primarily natural shapeshifters.

Animal-Human hybrids sometimes occur as the offspring of Chimeric fae or partial shapeshifters. They are usually sterile.

## Involuntary Shapeshifting

It is also possible to apply the methods involved in shapeshifting to another person, forcing them into a different form.
Due to the natural magical resistance of all living things, this is far more difficult than shapeshifting oneself, and is therfore limited to very powerful mages, and dragons, 
and is typically only employed as a particularly flashy display of power.

This may or may not include the necessary magics to preserve the targets mind in their new form. In either case, it is generally a bad idea to attempt this against individuals who are themselves skilled at shapeshifting, 
as they are often able to just shift back. Otherwise, the target will remain stuck in their new form.


Through a similar method, it is possible to force a shapeshifter back into their natural form. This is not as difficult as forcibly shifting someone, but still quite hard.
