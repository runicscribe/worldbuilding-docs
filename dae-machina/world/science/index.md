# Science

The mages and philosophers of Dael have discovered much of how the Dae'machina works.

Because of the ways in which Evocation, Channelling, Transmutation, Sympathy, and Enchanting interact with the physical world, 
magical research into these schools has also unlocked more mundane knowledge about the nature of matter and energy.

However, this knowledge is primarly focused on magical applications, and has a number of blind spots.
Mundane researchers also exist, and are the primary driver for more in-depth scientific knowledge.
However, the commonality of magic and how its expression is so often tied to passion means that apparent breakthroughs are more often caused by the (unknown) expression of latent magic, making consistent progress difficult.

## [Materials](./materials)

Dae'machina has 14 base elements. Everything else is some form of compound.

In adition to their natural properties, many conventional materials interact in unique ways with magical phenomena. The magical nature of this world also results in a number of unique magical materials.

## Physics

Because of the existance an ubiquity of magic, most physical laws are maleable. However, in the absence of magic, the world does behave in predictable ways.

Conservation of momentum
Conservation of Energy\*
 \* this breaks down at high energies, where energy can transform into Arcana
 
Entropy cannot be meaningfuly defined in the absence of magic, as it correlates to the Aetherial nature of a region (as well as any Arcana that is present). 
While all purely phisical processes will act to increase entrophy, magical processes may decrease entrophy. Entropy does not have a definable minimum or maximum.

Velocity has no known maxima. High velocities may cause magical effects.
For the purposes of defining a magnitude of velocity, the universe of Dae'machina has a single fixed reference reference point, at the rotation axis of the world of Dael.

Temperature has no known minima or maxima, though extreme temperatures may cause magical effects.
