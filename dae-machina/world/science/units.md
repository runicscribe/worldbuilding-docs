# Units

## Base Measures

Most peoples have at least some system of measurement for time, distance, and mass, though the specifics vary greatly.

### Time

See also [calendar](../cosmology/calendar).

Two measures of time are fairly universal across Dael:
 - The span of a day
 - The time between two great convergences (252 days), called a Lokan (singular and plural) in Eaos-Mhidda, and a Yushin in Quon Xi.

When a day is said to start can vary a bit. Most cultures mark the start of a day by either noon or midnight, but some use dawn instead.
When a year starts is a bit more consistent. Most cultures use the time of the trilunar convergence as the start of their year. 
However, the trilunar convergence is only visible from Quon Xi and eastern Eaos so some cultures instead use the midyear gold-copper convergence as the start of their year, especially cultures on Kita Lau and Xuon.

There are few commonly used units of time larger than 252 days.
 - The Daal'fae sometimes measure time in "cycles" - the time for the pattern of semi-annual caravan gatherings to repeat. The length of a cycle varies from caravan to caravan:
	- Northern Foothills - One cycle is 3 Convergences
	- Great Plains, Crescent Route, and Center Inland tribes - One cycle is 7 convergences
	- Eastern Valley - One cycle is 9 Convergences
	- Eastern Mountain - One cycle is 12 Convergences
 - Dragons often measure time in "Gatherings" (756 convergences) and "Gatherings of Gatherings" (571,536 convergences).
 
Units of time that fall between a day and a year vary greatly among different cultures.
 - The 36-day Kahda (The time for one orbit of the goldmoon) and the 6-day Hekad are common across Eaos-Mhidda.
 - Some cultures instead use 63 days (the silvermoon orbit) or 84 days (the coppermoon orbit), along with fractions thereof.
 - Other cultures don't use fixed sub-year time intervals, and instead use more varied time intervals based on convergences or eclipses (e.g. some Xhal'fae use the time between eclipses, which can vary from 10 hours to 21 days)
 - The Daal'fae typically use the time for one caravan circuit as their primary sub-year measure. This varies from caravan-to-caravan, from 84 to 252 days. Often they'll also use a unique name for each day in this cycle rather than weekday names.

Measures of time less than a day are not typically standardized in the same way days and years are.

For very small time intervals, some measure based on the length of a heartbeat is most common. How long this actually is can vary, as the mean resting heart rate of most fae is faster than that of other Aeldar
and the mean resting heart rate of dragons is slower than that of Aeldar. 
Sapients without hearts, such as elementals, liches, and eldar 'jinn don't have such a baseline, and often use the time it takes them to achieve some magical effect as a base unit (e.g, how long a dryad takes to manifest).

For larger sub-day intervals, fractions of a day (most often 24 or 36), or arbitrary intervals based on some phenomena (time for a candle to burn, time for an hourglass to empty) are used.
Many larger cities have a bell-tower, to mark fractions of a day. Otherwise, people figure out meeting times based on the position of the sun. 


### Distance

Probably the most commonly unit of distance is the span of 1 hours travel on foot.
Depending on how the culture's measurent of an hour (i.e. if they count 24 or 36 hours in a day), the actual distance this represents can vary.

Other units are typically anthopocentric - strides, width of a hand/finger, etc.
Most larger civilizations have at least some set of standard measures at this scale. The Furthern Dal have perhaps the most comprehensive set of standard units.

Most 'fae communities tend to use solely informal measures.
The Daal'fae often use the dahuf - the distance of 1 days travel. This varies a bit by tribe.
Selkies use different measures for lenght and depth based around ocean travel; they have also adapted these measures to land use.

### Mass

Measured of mass are usually rather standardized, in order to facilitate trade and currency. The specific metric of standardization varies.
Seeds - Commonly used for smaller measures across Eaos.
Stone
Cord (of wood)
Barrel (full of liquid)


## Esoteric Measures

### Measures of Magic

Arcana and Arcane Flux

### Temperature

Typically measured magiaclly, derived from arcana.
