# Materials

In adition to their natural properties, many conventional materials
interact in unique ways with magical phenomena. The magical nature of
this world also results in a number of unique magical materials.

## Elements

Dae'machina has 14 base elements. Everything else is some form of compound.


### Primes

The Primes consist of the only two elements that are not naturally stable, decaying into energy under certain conditions.
Compounds that incoporate both Brightstone and Darkstone, even if in only trace ammounts, will inevitably decay.

#### Sunfire

Sunfire is most often found in the form of a fragile, transparent crystal. This crystal rapidly decays at low pressures (less than 1000 atm) or regions of low arcana, emmiting massive amounts of heat, light, and arcana.

When its stable form, sunfire acts as if it contains arcana, but also attracts external sources of arcana, which appear to flow through it freely.
It also warps aether around it.

Sunfire can spontaneously form in areas of very high magic.

At high temp + pressure, it can bind with other elements, significantly increasing terrestrial stability.
Generally increases magical potency, but can also have unusual physical effects.

Sometimes called Brightstone.

#### Darkstone

A britle, opaque black crystal that excludes arcana and aether. This material is durable, but explodes violently if damaged, releasing a burst of arcana.
If arcana does somehow intersect with darkstone, it'll also cause an explosion.

Darkstone can spontaneously form in areas that are both devoid of magic and subject to a negative flow of Arcana.


### Metals

Strong, lustrous, maleable, and conductive to heat, electricity, and (often) magic.

Magically, metals tend to be good at holding enchantments or directly
manipulating magic. Metals tend to be poor at holding sympathetic
bonds, due to their maleable, uniform nature.

#### Gold (Aurum)

A bright metallic yellow metal that is dense, soft, maleable, and very conductive.
Does not oxidize or tarnish.
Conducts magic. Usefull for extending the effect of an enchantment.	Good enchanting material.
As a sympathetic focus, it can be used to attract, amplify, and conduct arcana, and focus aether; genrally, it can make any spell more efficient. 

#### Silver (Argent)

A metallic light grey metal of moderate density. Somewhat soft and maleable, and hightly conductive.
Tarnishes to black over time.

Disrupts magic (Effects and encantments). Notable for being effictive against natural magical beings such as elementals.
Difficult to use effectively in magical workings as it naturally disrupts magic, but can be used as an encantation focus for disrupting arcana and aether.

#### Copper (Alkyne)

A metallic pinkish-orange metal of moderate density. Soft, maleable, and very conductive.
Oxidizes to pale grey-green.

Naturally absorbs and retains magic it comes into contact with (Magic "sticks" to it). Forms a natural sympathetic connection to its past owner or location.
Poor enchantment medium as it tends to get corrupted by other magical influences. Good for holding temporary sympathetic bonds.
Can be used as a sympathetic focus for storing arcana and binding aether.  


#### Iron

A metallic grey metal of moderate density. Strong and durable.
Oxidizes to redish brown.

Magically inert. Does not have any significant effect on magic; magic does not have any significant effect on it. 
Decent base metal for enchantments.	Often used in tools intended to manipulate magic items, as magic won't stick to it, and it won't disrupt the working.


#### Quicksilver

Liquid at most terrestrial temperatures. Nontoxic. Forms compounds readily with pure nonmetals, so relatively rare on Dael. 
Gradually forms an irridescent film on its surface when exposed to air.

Has little effect on magic, but is readily affected by it - will form floating droplets in areas of high Arcana. Often used in certain types of scrying and complex artifice due to these properties.
Can also be used as a focus to disrupt arcana and aether that is a little easier to work with than silver.

### Ethers

Elements that are naturally gaseous on Dael.

#### Aer

Active part of atmosphere, which all living things breathe. Comprises about 30% of Dael's atmosphere.
Required for combusion.

#### Dormis

Inert gas with a similar density to Aer. Comprises about 60% of Dael's atmosphere.
Insulator.


#### Nitrus

Semi-volatile gas, with a lower density to Aer. 
It is rarely found in its pure form, instead mostly appearing in compounds.

### Mundants

Elements that do not fit into any of the other categories.

#### Agua

A near-colorless transparent liquid that is the primary constituent of Dael's oceans.

#### Eter

Common element that readily forms compounds with other elements and itself.
Found in a variety of allotropes.
The most durable variant of Eter forms octahedral crystals, and is commonly called Diamond.

#### Sulphur

A yellow element which forms orthorhombic crystals.
Moderate thermal conductivity, electrical insulator.

#### Calcus

A britle, chalky white material which forms fibrous columnar crystals.
Thermal insulator, semicondictive.

### Alloys

Alloys are combinations of one or more metals, and often have unique
properties. Many alloys also contain trace amounts of magical materials
ond other nonmetals.

Often forms naturally during meteor impacts. | Easy to enchant | (Enchanted) weapons and armor. Most Uon armaments were forged from Meteoric iron. |
| Black Iron       | An alloy of Iron containing trace amounts of Darkstone. | Slightly heavier and more durable than regular iron. | Impermeamble to magic, cannot be affected by magic, and can pass through magical effects that would otherwise impede phisical objects. These properties are non-disruptive, and do not otherwise damage magical effects. | Better for weapons than armor, since seams and gaps are still vulnerable. |
| Shadow Steel     | An alloy of Iron and Carbon with trace amounds of Darkstone and Silver. | About as heavy as iron, but slightly stronger. Also called magebane steel or dark steel. | Projects an aura that is impermeable to magic. Can permanently disrupt magical effects on touch. | Anti-mage armaments |

### Alchemical Materials

By combining various magical and nonmagical materials, alchemists can
create materials with potent magical effects, without need for a mage.

#### Blackfire
A mixture of smokestone dust and gunpowder	Burns with a hot, lightless flame.
Commonly used in stealth operations for demolitions and sabotage.

#### Magebane powder
A mixture of runewood powder, bismuth dust, and blackfire. Burns with a hot blue flame.
Ignited by the slightest magical disturbance. Used in anti-mage traps, and to protect sensitive or confidential documents from magical scrying or other tampering.
