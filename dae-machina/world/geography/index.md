# Dae-Machina - The World

The central planet of Dae'machina is called Terra Mendael, and is 30787 km in circumference at the equator (About 77% the size of Earth).


# Mhidda - Northeastern Continent: 

The northernmost reaches of Mhidda are mostly wilderness, primarily alpine forest. 
The western reaches of the continent are inhabited by ‘daal, ‘midh, and midh'fae. Most settlements are fortified towns and castles surrounded by farmlands. Lone homesteads are rare; between ‘midh barbarian raids, dragons, wild animals, 
direwolves, and ‘fae, isolated settlements usually don’t survive.

There are numerous Æl'midh strongholds in or near the western side of the Dragonspine mountains. 
Fortified encampments of ‘midh can also be found near the shore, but they are usually inhabited by barbarians and raiders.
Many of the forests are inhabited by wolf fae, an offshoot of the daal’fae and the midh. Tribes of selkies (seal ‘fae) can be found in occasional coastal settlements.


## The Great Northern Forest

The northeast half of the continent is almost entirely free of civilization, inhabited only by Æl‘fae, elementals, and wildlife. 

### Tree of Ravens

Sanctum of the Queen of Ravens. Appears as a giant, twisted tree, merged from many different species.
The interior of the tree is full of shapeshifted biomass, mainly concerned with birthing more bodies for the Queen of Ravens.

### Grove of Infinities

Intersection of several Gyldraed domains, moslty of various forests, which unusually enough, have not merged.
Closest thing that existis to a Gyldraed community. 

## Dragonspine Mountains

The Dragonspine mountains are a large mountain chain stretching from the western edge of Mhidda to the southeastern edge of Eos, and serve as the dividing line between the two continents. 
The mountains are full of ‘midh strongholds to the north, ‘jinn palaces to the south, and dragon caves throughout. 

## Runesea Isles (Dhaigean Isles)

This large island is off the northwestern coast of the continent, and is inhabited by a unique civilization of ‘primitive’ midh, who specialize in enchanted warpaint.

## Isle of the Ancients

To the far east of the continent is a lone isle in a large bay, hosting old Aeldar ruins. It is sometimes used as a meeting place for the Eldar council.

# Eaos - Southeastern Continent:
The northwestern region of this continent consists of the Elyos Republic, and is predominantly inhabited by Æl'daal. Major settlements are focused around shores and rivers. The near inland regions are primarily farmland. 
Farther inland is primarily wilderness. Near the Dragonspine mountains there are a few scattered cities.

## Free Cities

The free cities are a chain of independently governed cities on the southern border of the Elyos Republic, centred around a couple of large rivers. This region is densely populated, and most cities are rarely more than a days 
travel apart. Farms, orchards and manor houses are found on the outskirts of the cities and between cities.

The southwestern region of Eaos is mostly jungle and swampland, and contains a city of shapeshifters (fae and non-fae). Swamp contains a variety of unique flora and fauna, including fairies, oozes, floating jellyfish, and 
various rare plants and ingredients. Many of the plants are active and hostile.
Southeast of the free cities is savannah populated by various Daal'fae tribes. 

## The Great Eaos Desert

Further southeast is a large desert, containing ruins of Ælmos, the original Ældar civilization, scattered oases, and numerous other ruins dating from the lich wars, some still with liches sealed in them.

## The 'Jinn Cities
Past the desert is the eastmost tip if the continent, containing the a number of Æl‘jinn.

# Quon Xi - Western Continent:

Quon Xi consists primarily of mountainous jungle regions and lush lowlands. It is controlled by the Æl'thal Empire of the Rising Sun.

# Dragon’s Teeth - Northern Archipelago: 
The Dragon's Teeth is a small chain of barren islands between the northern ends of the Quon Xi and Mhidda continents. It is inhabited primarily by arctic dragons.

# Kita Lau - Southern Archipelago

Kita Lau is a chain of tropical islands between Quon Xi and the Riftscape. It is inhabited by tribes of Æl'xhal (mostly hunter-gatherers and fisher-folk) and Xhal'fae.

# Riftscape

The Riftscape is a large artificial magical phenomena created when the Uon tried to create an artificial god/racial power source. This caused a magical overload across the Uon species, and threw the magical energies of the region 
into chaos. However, magic in this region is still strongly linked, and wizards are able to draw on vast amounts of magical power from any point in the riftscape. This effect becomes substantially more pronounced (and more 
unpredictable) towards the centre of the riftscape. Given that it encompasses the region that was once the Uon Empire, various ruins and artifacts are commonly found within the riftscape. There exist many very powerful Uon and 
Ældar artifacts within these ruins, which draws many adventurers to seek their fortune within the riftscape. Before the cataclysm, this region comprised a variety of landscapes, with jungles to the west, savannah and desert to 
the east, and various mountain ranges throughout the region. These regions are still represented throughout the riftscape. 
Prior to the cataclysm, this region was called Xuon by the Uon and Kwu Naa by the Æl'xhal
The riftscape extends from 45 W to 45 E and from 15 N to 75 S, and is about 10,000 km in diameter and is divided into four concentric regions:

## Edge

The edge region extends from 3,500 km from the centre of the rift to 5,000 km from the centre of the rift. It consists of rugged, blasted landscapes with frequent chasms, ravines, valleys and mountains. Earthquakes are frequent.
Heavily fortified riftlander settlements are scattered around the eastern edge of the riftscape.

## Outer Rift

The outer rift region extends from 2,000 km from the centre of the rift to 3,500 km from the centre of the rift. It consists of numerous islands, many of which are levitating above the surface of the ocean. These floating 
islands slowly drift in a counterclockwise direction around the centre of the rift. Magic in this region is unpredictable, and elementals and magical phenomena are common. The weather is chaotic and unpredictable, with frequent 
flash storms. Uon and Ældar ruins are common.

## Main Rift

The main rift region extends from 50 km from the centre of the rift to 2,000 km from the centre of the rift. It consists solely of floating islands levitating above the ocean. Both the islands and the ocean move in a 
counterclockwise direction around the centre of the rift. Magic is chaotic and completely unpredictable in this region. Reality is warped in this region, resulting in non-Euclidean geometries, time dilation, and unnatural 
behaviour of matter. Unstable short-lived elementals and other magical phenomena are common. Due to the unpredictable geography and chaotic magic of the region, the main rift is impossible to map or navigate. Various Uon ruins 
can be found among the floating islands.

## Eye 

The eye of the rift is the location of the original Uon ritual that caused the cataclysm, and is sympathetically linked to the entire riftscape. This region is a focal point for the magical energies of the entire riftscape, but 
this energy is impossible to access safely. Many feats of magic that would normally be impossible, such as limited time travel across the lifetime of the rift, and teleportation to any point inside the riftscape can be 
accomplished (albeit with a great deal of risk and unpredictability) can be accomplished from this location. In the eye, the seabed falls away to the mantle, creating a massive whirlpool and steam clouds, which spawn constant 
storms and monsoons in the main rift. At the very centre of the eye,
