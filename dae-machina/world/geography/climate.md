# Climate

Due to a short solar year and lack of axial tilt, Dael has no real seasons. As a result, the climate is fairly stable.
There are some large cyclical climate shifts, with a variety of causes.
 - Ocean current and atmospheric interactions, which can produce severe storms and/or push weather and temperature their usual ranges. Most of these shifts tend to be somewhat consistent
 - Certain types of powerfull elementals can effect the weather in a large area around them. Some of these have cyclical migration routes. Others are more mercurial, and can arrive unexpectedly.
 
The Uuon cataclysm has altered many of these natural cycles, and the world is still getting used to the new normal.
The weather around the rift is almost perpetuly stormy, with clouds, rain, fog, and high winds.
