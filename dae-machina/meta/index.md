# Meta

Out-of-universe information about Dae-machina, mostly about how it relates to Earth.

## Units and Sizes

Terra Mendael dimensions: 9800 km in diameter/30787 km circumference (0.76911 the size of earth)

Mass = 3.038e24 kg
Volume = 4.928e20 m3
Gravity is 8.445 m/s2 (0.86 of earth)
Which gives density of 6165 kg/m3, 11.6% higher than earth; within acceptable bounds.

## Cosmology

Earth-centric layout, with a small, close, sun means that the sun's rays are less parallel than on earth and that dawn and dusk last longer.

## Chemistry

Only 14 elements - 12 mundane, 2 magical.
At the atomic scale, things are very different than earth materials, but at anything larger than that, things look basically the same.

Broad equivalents of most earth materials exist, but aren't always quite the same.
Loose equivalents to higher-order members of the elemental groups (outside the noble metals) are formed from compounds.

Water (Agua) is an element, not a molecule.
Silicon compounds instead are based on Calcus + Eter, so a silicate is a Calcus-Eter-Aer compound.
Quicksilver is largely nontoxic, and has as much in common with nickel as with actual mercury.

Radioactivity doesn't exist, but the magical decay caused by compounds containing both Starfire and Darksteel behaves similarly.

## Creatures

The presence of dragons over the past several million years Dragons have had a notable affect on the presence of large mammals and megafauna in general.
Largest animal species are Island Whals (Aquatic Concha), Wurms (Aquatic/Subterranean Cercis), and Krakens (Aquatic Cercis).
Apart from Wurms and Dragons, the largest land animals are Concha - Shorecombers and Armored Bicorns 

The largest mammals are bears and yaks.

No even-toed ungulates (in particular horses). Animal transport is slow - oxen and such.
No whales. Only aquatic mammals are seals, otters, and similar.


## Cultural Inspirations

Eoas - mostly greek inspiried, although with some renaisance itally and late middle ages europe mixed in. Architecture - especially larger cities - also has some India / Middle east inspiration, with large, flat-domed buildings. 

Djinn - some middle east aesthetic inspiration, but immortal rulers makes culture rather strange.

Ael'Thal / Quon Xi - cultural and architectural similarities to ancient China, but the Ael'Thal themselves look more like high elves and incorporate a lot of those tropes.
Also have the strongest navy of any nation currently, so there's some colonial europe vibes there as well.

Ael Xhal - Mix of Mesoamerica and oceanic islands

City of bridges / other regions near Quon Xi are more like Korea / Japan

Ael'Midh - Mix of Celtic, Norse, Medival Europe, and Fantasy Dwarf inspirations.

Old Ael - Egypt/Babylon/Mesopotamia

## Language

Old Aeldar - Latin based

## Dragons

All one species, but extreemely varies in appearance - much like dogs in that respect 
Rather being caused by domestication and specialization (as is the case with dogs), this was instead caused by a mix of dynasty-building alongside shapeshifting and other appearance-affecting magic.
