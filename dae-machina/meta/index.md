# Meta

Out-of-universe information about Dae-machina, mostly about how it relates to Earth.

## Units and Sizes

Terra Mendael dimensions: 9800 km in diameter/30787 km circumference (0.76911 the size of earth)

In universe measure is typically the league - distance traveled on foot in 1 hour.
 - For cultures that use 24-hour days, this corresponds to 2 miles or 3.22 km
 - For cultures that use 36-hour days, this corresponds to 3 miles or 4.83 km


Mass = 3.038e24 kg
Volume = 4.928e20 m3
Gravity is 8.445 m/s2 (0.86 of earth)
Which gives density of 6165 kg/m3, 11.6% higher than earth; within acceptable bounds.

1 Day is 24 hours
1 week is 6 days
1 month is 36 days (6 weeks)
1 year is 252 days (7 months; 42 weeks).

TODO: Find an in-unerverse alternative term for Year, to differentiate from earth-year, then adjust lifespans accordingly. (x1.42)


Moons are all 1000 km diameter, with varying densities
Vol = 5.23e23 cm3

Mass:
  Brightsun: 2.09e21 kg
  Darksun:   2.62e21 kg
  Aurum:     1.01e22 kg
  Argent:    5.49e21 kg
  Alkyne:    4.69e21 kg

Earth's moon: 7.35e22 kg
Orbital distance of moon = 384400 km

Tidal force ~ M/d3
Theoretical Amplitude contributions:
Suns 3.4e6    1.42m
Moons
 Aurum - 0.081m
 Argent - 0.015m
 Alkyne - 0.007m

Sample plot: 1.42*cos(4*pi*x) + 0.081*cos(4*pi*x/36)  + 0.015*cos(4*pi*x/63) + 0.007*cos(4*pi*x/84) from 0 to 252

Tides are more uniform than on earth, with a fairly consistent twice daily high tide at noon and midnight. 
Maximal tides are about double the norm on earth. Minimal tides are about triple the norm on earth.
The influence of the moons - mainly Aurum, adds a +/1 5% annual variation. (Compare with earth, with a ~30% variation from the sun)


## Cosmology

Earth-centric layout, with a small, close, sun means that the sun's rays are less parallel than on earth and that dawn and dusk last longer.

## Science

### Physics

Newtonian mechanics apply (in the absence of magic).
Classical electromagnetism works more or less the same (after accounting for the differences in atomic/molecular physics)
There is no maximum speed or minimum temperature
The laws of Thermodynamics loosly apply (particularly the 0th and 1st), though entrophy may be reduced through magic. Entropy does not have a definable minimum or maximum.

Special and General relatively do not apply. Time dialation is only achievable through magic.
Radioactivity doesn't exist, but the magical decay caused by compounds containing both Starfire and Darksteel behaves similarly. 
The sun (and other star) are very different than in the real world, and are intensely magical. See Cosmology. 

The strong and weak nuclear forces don't really exist - atomic phyisics works very differently than on earth (See Chemistry)

The Laws of Gravitation work the same, although the major celestial bodies are all in superstable orbits that are maintained by an external magical force.

### Chemistry

Only 14 elements - 12 mundane, 2 magical.
At the atomic scale, things are very different than earth materials, but at anything larger than that, things look basically the same.

Broad equivalents of most earth materials exist, but aren't always quite the same.
Loose equivalents to higher-order members of the elemental groups (outside the noble metals) are formed from compounds.

Water (Agua) is an element, not a molecule.
Silicon compounds instead are based on Calcus + Eter, so a silicate is a Calcus-Eter-Aer compound.
Quicksilver is largely nontoxic, and has as much in common with nickel as with actual mercury.

## Creatures

The presence of dragons over the past several million years Dragons have had a notable affect on the presence of large mammals and megafauna in general.
Largest animal species are Island Whals (Aquatic Concha), Wurms (Aquatic/Subterranean Cercis), and Krakens (Aquatic Cercis).
Apart from Wurms and Dragons, the largest land animals are Concha - Shorecombers and Armored Bicorns 

The largest mammals are bears and yaks.

No even-toed ungulates (in particular horses). Animal transport is slow - oxen and such.
No whales. Only aquatic mammals are seals, otters, and similar. Aquatic megafauna is all crustaceans.
No rodents - pest species are mostly insects, with some lizards and jellies.

## Cultural Inspirations

Eoas - mostly greek inspiried, although with some renaisance itally and late middle ages europe mixed in. Architecture - especially larger cities - also has some India / Middle east inspiration, with large, flat-domed buildings. 

Djinn - some middle east aesthetic inspiration, but immortal rulers makes culture rather strange.

Ael'Thal / Quon Xi - cultural and architectural similarities to ancient China, but the Ael'Thal themselves look more like high elves and incorporate a lot of those tropes.
Also have the strongest navy of any nation currently, so there's some colonial europe vibes there as well.

Ael Xhal - Mix of Mesoamerica and oceanic islands

Dragonhalls - Andes highland regions, e.g. EL Alto (Bolivia), Quito (Equator), Chota Vally

City of bridges / other regions near Quon Xi are more like Korea / Japan

Ael'Midh - Mix of Celtic, Norse, Medival Europe, and Fantasy Dwarf inspirations.

Old Ael - Egypt/Babylon/Mesopotamia

## Language

Old Aeldar - Latin based

## Dragons

All one species, but extreemely varies in appearance - much like dogs in that respect 
Rather being caused by domestication and specialization (as is the case with dogs), this was instead caused by a mix of dynasty-building alongside shapeshifting and other appearance-affecting magic.

The meeting of the dragons once every 756 years (190512 days) is the product of the orbital periods of the three moons.
