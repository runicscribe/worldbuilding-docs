# Adventuring Parties

## Newbies

All Lvl 1 - 4

Lvl 1 Male Kobold Fighter - Thinks he's a fierce warior and the leader of the party. Wizard treats him as the team pet, Rogue treats him as an always-willing fucktoy.
Lvl 3 Female Human Rogue - Goth Nympho
Lvl 2 Female Human Wizard - Shy, clumsy, nice. Secretly a bit of an exhibitionist. Uses mainly fire and wind magic.
Lvl 4 Female Dwarf Cleric - "Team Mom". Tough, keeps everyone alive. Amused by the other's antics

## Monster Team

Adventuring Party consisting entirely of "monster" races (which is a rarity)

Female Gorgon Cleric - Cadeceus Staff & Hooded white robes.
Female Arachne Rogue - The largest party member, but still the stealthiest. Into bondage (Dom).
Male Vampire Bard - Very flamboyant. Wields a rapier and a viola, although also adept with the pipe organ, panpipes, accordion, and other similar instruments.
Female Cat Monk - Lazy when not in combat - Strives to always be fighting, drinking, fucking or sleeping - sometimes more than one at once. 
Male Gnoll Fighter - Wears heavy armor and wields a Kanab≈ç. Outcast from his clan. Socially assertive but sexually submissive.
