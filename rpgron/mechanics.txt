# Mechanics

## Attributes

3 Attributes:

* Strength: Weapon damage and physical endurance
* Personality: Persuasion & Barter, Disguise & Stealth 
* Willpower: Spellcasting and Mental Fortitude

Adventurers start with 1 point of each, plus 4 additional points to distrubute among them.

Gain 1 extra point at Level 5 and again at Level 20

### Attribute Tests

Test attribute against a threshold

Active: Add 1D4 to attribute value
Passive: Use unmodified Attribute value

Standard difficulty thresholds of active (A) and passive (P) tests follow (althogh higher thresholds are possible):

           A  P
Trivial:   3  1  
Easy:      4  2
Normal:    5  3
Moderate:  6  4
Hard:      7  5
Epic:      8  6
Legendary: 9  7

## Encounters

Before combat, can try to bargain, flee, or fight. Depending on circumstances and disposition, all options might not be possible.
(There's also an ambush mechanic, that goes both ways - ambusher gets a bonus on acting)
For lairs and dungeons, this only occurs on first encounter and bosses, results determine future combats in that zone.

### Wandering monsters

Strictly region specific

### Lairs

Small, with boss
Usually themed to region, but not always

### Dungeons

Large, with minibosses and end boss


## Appendix A: List of class attributes

Adventurer Startin Classes

Past Level 5 class attributes overlap somewhat;
Class is still determined by starting distrubition, with increases determining specialization.
For example, a Level 5 Cleric with Str 3 Per 2 Will 3 (War-Priest) might have the same attributes
as a Level 5 Monk with Str 3 Per 2 Will 3 (Guru)

Basic Classes: Warrior / Bard / Mage - Focus on one attribute, maybe with a small apeciallization.
